**# **# Unit Conversion Package****

This Python package provides a collection of functions for unit conversions across different categories such as length, weight, time, data size, area, and volume. The package is designed to make it easy to convert values from one unit to another. To use the package, simply import the desired conversion functions from `unitconv` and utilize them in your code. For example:

## **# Installation Guide**

On your terminal (Command Prompt) write the following command. 
`pip install convertunit`
Hit Enter.

**## Usage Guide**

```python
from convertunit import conv

x = 2000
a = conv.cm2m(x)
print(f'The answer is {a}m')
```

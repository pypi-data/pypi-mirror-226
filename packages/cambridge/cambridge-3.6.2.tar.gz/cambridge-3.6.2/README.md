# Cambridge

`cambridge` is a terminal version of Cambridge Dictionary, with its data from https://dictionary.cambridge.org

By default, it is English to English translation. For English to Chinese, add '-c' or '--chinese' option.

Supports looking up the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, with `-w` or `--webster` option. Webster has no foreign language translation in itself.

## Why This
I'm a terminal person tired of pulling out a GUI app or browser, inputting words in the search bar, hitting the search button and then waiting for the result to render with a bunch of unnecessary static files coming along. Not only is the time taken long, but also switching apps back and forth can be annoying. So I wrote this console application with features to my satisfaction.

## Highlights 
1. `camb <word/phrase>` to look it up in Cambridge Dictionary by default
2. `-w` flag to fetch Merriam-Webster Dictionary
3. less than 2s taken to do all the work for the word, including fetching, parsing, printing, and writing cache
4. less than 0.1s for the same word's later search
5. only the first dictionary from Cambridge, avoiding confuses by multiple dictionaries
6. a list of word/phrase suggestions will be given, if not found
7. `camb l` to list words and phrases you've found before

## `fzf`
With [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed, `camb l | fzf --preview 'camb {}'` will get you a taste of the `fzf` magic: 
1. display the whole word list
2. fuzzy find a word from the word list & preview its meaning instantly 
3. preview each word definition instantly as you scroll through the list
4. `alias cambl="camb l | fzf --preview 'camb {}'"` can be added in your bashrc for convenience

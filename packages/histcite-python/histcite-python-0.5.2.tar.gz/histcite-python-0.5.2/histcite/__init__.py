## What is HistCite-Python?
HistCite-Python is a Python package for parsing scientific papers' references and recognize citation relathiship between them. 

It's originated from the [HistCite project](https://support.clarivate.com/ScientificandAcademicResearch/s/article/HistCite-No-longer-in-active-development-or-officially-supported),
which is no longer maintained by Clarivate for some years. With pandas 2.0 and Graphviz, HistCite-Python has implemented the core functions of HistCite, and extended some new features.

- Support multiple OS systems, Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
- Support multiple literature database, Web of Science, Scopus, CSSCI.

HistCite-Python is an **open source** project, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/doublessay/histcite-python).
If you have any questions or suggestions, please submit an issue on GitHub. 

Certainly, welcome to contribute to this project.

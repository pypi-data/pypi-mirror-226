## Usage Guide

Our team working hard and the usage guide will be avilable within 24hrs on http://emonic.vvfin.in or https://github.com/embrake/emonic/

## Batteries Support 

Installation of EmonicAdmin v1

```bash
pip install emonic-admin

```

## Create emonic project

```bash
emonic-admin startproject -i {projectName}
```

## Emonic Instance @secure

```python
# app.py

from emonic.core.branch import Emonic

app = Emonic(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'], secure=True, pin="your_secret_pin")
def secureRoute(request):
    return "You have accessed the secure route! "

### In this code we defined app as Emonic(__name__) instance then pass the secure = True and set the pin, by passing these deatils the Emonic will locked that particular route which you secure, if someone try to access the route the Emonic ask for a pin before accessing that route if pin is matched with your passed pin in that route the user will allow to get access of that route else it through a incorrect pin error until user pass the correct pin.

```
## Emonic Instance @BaseFeatures

```python
# app.py

from emonic.core.branch import Emonic

app = Emonic(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'],  max_url_length=None, default=None, host=None, strict_slashes=None)
def base(request):
    return "Welcome"

```

## Mailer 1.0.0

```python 
# mailer.py

## Now you can setup the mailer through the Emonic-Admin batteries ($project) > settings.py file

MAILER = [
    {
        "SMTP": "", ## SMTP for e.g, smtp.gmail.com
        "PORT": , ## PORT SSL 447 TLS 587
        "USERNAME": "", # Your Account Username or email
        "PASSWORD": "", # Your Account Password
        "SSL": , # Choose the SSL Security either True or False
        "DEFAULT_SENDER": "" # Default send Account or email
    }
]

## With using Mailer 1.0.0 you can now, use Bluk email sending and Send email Template with a timelimit and send a email with a paticular template.

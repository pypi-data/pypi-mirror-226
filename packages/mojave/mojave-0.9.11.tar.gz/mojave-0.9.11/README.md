## Tooig Operating System

Mojave is an architecture designed stritly to deliver on automation. 

We designed it to help manage certain backend functions that will bug the process of software and operations at Tooig in the future. it is also versatile enough that it can be used to develop other smaller variants.

Our first instance of a small variant is Genie. So far we've completed the build but we still need to run tests.



So far, we've given Mojave the ability to think, read and write from and to its long term memory. All we now need to do is to create the main tool needed for the actual rendering of 3D to the human interface.

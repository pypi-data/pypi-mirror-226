        This method is responsible to register the event handlers
        associated to the LR scheduler. In particular, it should
        register the event to call the ``step`` method of the LR
        scheduler. If the optimizer is ``None``, this function should
        return ``None``  because it does not make sense to define a LR
        scheduler without an optimizer.

            engine (``gravitorch.engines.BaseEngine``): Specifies an
                engine.
            optimizer (``torch.nn.Optimizer``): Specifies the
                optimizer.

            ``LRSchedulerType`` or ``None``: The created LR scheduler
                or ``None`` if there is no LR scheduler to create.

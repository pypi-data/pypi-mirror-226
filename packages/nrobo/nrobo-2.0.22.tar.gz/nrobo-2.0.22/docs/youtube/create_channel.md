## Tips for Managing Multiple YouTube Channels
Managing multiple YouTube channels isn’t too difficult, but there are certain chords you should try to strike to ensure that every channel resonates with its audience.

Here’s what you need:

### Ensure that your brand is as conspicuous as possible
Your brand is your strength. Make sure that every user that visits your channel can instantly connect with your business. And that means adding your official logo as the channel icon. If you have a brand tagline, be sure to include it somewhere in your channel’s bio.
### Have the perfect channel description
A killer description is key to unlocking your visibility. You should keep it brief but use keywords to boost your channel’s SEO. You may also include a link to your website if you have one.
### Stick to a predictable publishing schedule
To keep your viewers coming back for more, it’s important to have a consistent, predictable publishing schedule. If you decide to publish one video per week, for instance, you could make it 4 PM every Tuesday, but stick to it.

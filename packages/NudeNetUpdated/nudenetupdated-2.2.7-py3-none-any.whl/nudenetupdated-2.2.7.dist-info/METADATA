|EXPOSED_BELLY | Exposed Belly; Any gender |
|COVERED_BUTTOCKS | Provocative, but covered Buttocks; Any gender |
|EXPOSED_BUTTOCKS | Exposed Buttocks; Any gender |
|FACE_F | Female Face|
|FACE_M | Male Face|
|COVERED_FEET |Covered Feet; Any gender |
|EXPOSED_FEET | Exposed Feet; Any gender|
|COVERED_BREAST_F | Provocative, but covered Breast; Female |
|EXPOSED_BREAST_F | Exposed Breast; Female |

|EXPOSED_BREAST_M |Exposed Breast; Male |
|EXPOSED_GENITALIA_M |Exposed Genitalia; Male |

## Usage

### As Python module

**Installation**:

```bash
pip install --upgrade nudenetupdated
```

**Classifier Usage**:

```python
# Import module
from nudenet import NudeClassifier

# initialize classifier (downloads the checkpoint file automatically the first time)
classifier = NudeClassifier()

# Classify single image
classifier.classify('path_to_image_1')
# Returns {'path_to_image_1': {'safe': PROBABILITY, 'unsafe': PROBABILITY}}
# Classify multiple images (batch prediction)
# batch_size is optional; defaults to 4
classifier.classify(['path_to_image_1', 'path_to_image_2'], batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
# Returns {'path_to_image_1': {'safe': PROBABILITY, 'unsafe': PROBABILITY},
#          'path_to_image_2': {'safe': PROBABILITY, 'unsafe': PROBABILITY}}

```

**Detector Usage**:

```python
# Import module
from nudenet import NudeDetector

# initialize detector (downloads the checkpoint file automatically the first time)
detector = NudeDetector() # detector = NudeDetector('base') for the "base" version of detector.

# Detect single image
detector.detect('path_to_image')
# fast mode is ~3x faster compared to default mode with slightly lower accuracy.
detector.detect('path_to_image', mode='fast')
# Returns [{'box': LIST_OF_COORDINATES, 'score': PROBABILITY, 'label': LABEL}, ...]
```

## Developpers

To get started, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start developing your project.

| Command     |       Description        |
| ----------- | :----------------------: |
| make test   |   Run your unit tests    |
| make lint   |      Lint your code      |
| make format |     Format your code     |
| make mypy   | Run static type checking |

### Notes

- Current version of NudeDetector is trained on 160,000 entirely auto-labelled (using classification heat maps and various other hybrid techniques) images.
- The entire data for the classifier is available at https://archive.org/details/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1
- A part of the auto-labelled data (Images are from the classifier dataset above) used to train the base Detector is available at https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet/releases/download/v0/DETECTOR_AUTO_GENERATED_DATA.zip

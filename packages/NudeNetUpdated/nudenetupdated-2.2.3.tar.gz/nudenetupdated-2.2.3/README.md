## Python DevTools Boilerplate

Introducing the Python DevTools Boilerplate, an advanced and feature-rich project template tailored for Python developers. This boilerplate is designed to help you kick-start your Python projects with the best development tools and configurations, giving you a solid foundation for efficient and streamlined development. The boilerplate includes:

- Poetry for dependency management
- Flake8 for linting
- Black for code formatting
- Mypy for static type checking
- pytest for testing
- hupper for monitoring python files

### Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/shahzayb/python-devtools-boilerplate.git

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start developing your project.

To start the project in watch mode, run:

# Pyenopt code
This package contains code related to the pyenopt package for ensemble based
optimization. 

Currently it contains a plugin for the main pyenopt package to provide backwards
compatibility with a legacy sqlite database interface ot pyenopt.

The main pyenopt optimizer code itself is currently an internal project, but
will be released as open-source in the near future. Until then, adding parts of
the code that can be released already, like this plugin, are added
incrementally.

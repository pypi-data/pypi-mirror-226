## Additional notes


This is an Alpha version I wrote during a mystical crisis so don't blame anyone if that doesn't work in every situation.
It will be better soon... or probably not... I find it so lovely as it is... even with the exception when you press CTRL+C.

I almost forgot... Thanks to Shoutcast and people who are making those beautiful radio stations...

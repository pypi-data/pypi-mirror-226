OPENTIVA
========

opentiva is a free and open-source python module that simulates target 
controlled infusions by using mathematical models relating to the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic compartment models of drugs used in 
anaesthetic practice. 

Usage examples can be found in the examples directory.

Example web app using the module can be found at 
`opentiva.com <https://opentiva.com>`_

Full documentation can be found `here <https://opentiva.readthedocs.io>`_

Features
--------

- Plasma and effect site targeting
- One, two and three compartment modelling
- Built in Pk/Pd models from a range of drugs
- Tpeak ke0 calcuation
- User defined infusions
- Optional k20 elimination in two compartment modelling
- Customize a range of properties relating to the targetting and maintenance 
  methods

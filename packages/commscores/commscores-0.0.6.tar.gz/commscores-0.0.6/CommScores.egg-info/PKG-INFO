Microbial communities predicate most biological systems on Earth, yet the interaction dynamics between community members remains opaque. Quantitative metrics offer a means of isolating these complex, multi-dimensional, interactions into single biological dimensions; although, several ostensibly important biological dimensions evade existing metrics and extant metrics have moreover not be consolidated into a single operable package. We therefore developed CommScores as a comprehensive package for quantifying microbial interaction dimensions within a microbial community, and thereby elucidating the dynamics that govern the given community. CommScores leverages `ModelSEEDpy <https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDpy>`_ and `COBRApy <https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy>`_ packages for metabolic modeling, and the `COBRA-KBase <https://github.com/fliu/cobrakbase>`_ package for acquiring genomic information from KBase. CommScores should accelerate fundamental discoveries in microbial ecology and the rational design of microbial communities for diverse applications in medicine, ecology, and industry.

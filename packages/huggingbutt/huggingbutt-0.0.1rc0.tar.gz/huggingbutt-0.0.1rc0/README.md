# HuggingButt Python Client 
Client library to download and publish environments, agents on the huggingbutt.com hub

## Installation
After testing, this package can run stably under python version 3.9 on Windows/MacOS platform. Other versions of python may not be able to install this package, mainly because mlagents-envs has not been updated recently. I will address these issues later on. 

Create a new python environment using anaconda or miniconda
```shell
conda create -n p39 python=3.9
```

install from pypi
```shell
pip install huggingbutt
```
or from source code
```shell

```

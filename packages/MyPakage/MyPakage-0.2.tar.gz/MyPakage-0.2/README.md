this code is used for my learning, 
because other wheels are not enough or perfect  
author: nwkami.   
init.py should put in a path named as your package name,and "name = "example_pkg""in it
again i move the code py into the path where init in.and in init we write "from xxx import *"  
then this version is the first usable version

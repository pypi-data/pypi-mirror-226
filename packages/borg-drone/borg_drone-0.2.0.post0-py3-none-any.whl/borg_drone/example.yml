# borg-drone configuration consists of two main sections: 'repositories' and 'archives'
#
# Repositories are local or remote (SSH) targets where the borg repository will be created.
# Many repositories can be defined in this section, but only those referenced by an archive will be used.
#
# Archives are local to the machine running borg-drone and define the folders to be backed up and excluded.
# All archives defined here will be used by default.

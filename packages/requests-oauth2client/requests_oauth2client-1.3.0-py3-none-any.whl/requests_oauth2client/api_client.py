class ApiClient:
    """A Wrapper around [requests.Session][] with extra features for Rest API calls.

    Additional features compared to [requests.Session][]:

    - Allows setting a root url at creation time, then passing relative urls at request time.
    - It may also raise exceptions instead of returning error responses.
    - You can also pass additional kwargs at init time, which will be used to configure the [Session][requests.Session],
    instead of setting them later.
    - for parameters passed as `json`, `params` or `data`, values that are `None` can be automatically discarded from the request
    - boolean values in `data` or `params` fields can be serialized to values that are suitable for the target API, like `"true"` or `"false"`, or `"1"` / `"0"`, instead of the default values `"True"` or `"False"`.

    `base_url` will serve as root for relative urls passed to [ApiClient.request()][requests_oauth2client.api_client.ApiClient.request], [ApiClient.get()][requests_oauth2client.api_client.ApiClient.get], etc.
    An `HTTPError` will be raised everytime an API call returns an error code (>= 400), unless you set `raise_for_status` to `False`.
    Additional parameters passed at init time, including `auth` will be used to configure the [Session][requests.Session].

    Usage:
        ```python
        from requests_oauth2client import ApiClient

        api = ApiClient("https://myapi.local/resource", timeout=10)
        resp = api.get("/myid")  # this will send a GET request
        # to https://myapi.local/resource/myid

        # you can pass an underlying requests.Session at init time
        session = requests.Session()
        session.proxies = {"https": "https://localhost:3128"}
        api = ApiClient("https://myapi.local/resource", session=session)

        # or you can let ApiClient init it's own session and provide additional configuration parameters:
        api = ApiClient(
            "https://myapi.local/resource", proxies={"https": "https://localhost:3128"}
        )
        ```

    Args:
        base_url: the base api url, that should be root for all the target API endpoints.
        auth: the [requests.auth.AuthBase][] to use as authentication handler.
        timeout: the default timeout, in seconds, to use for each request from this ApiClient. Can be set to `None` to disable timeout.
        raise_for_status: if `True`, exceptions will be raised everytime a request returns an error code (>= 400).
        none_fields: if `"exclude"` (default), `data` or `json` fields whose values are `None` are not included in the request. If `"include"`, they are included with string value `None` (this is the default behavior of `requests`). If "empty", they are included with an empty value (as an empty string).
        bool_fields: a tuple of (true_value, false_value). Fields from `data` or `params` with a boolean value (`True` or `False`) will be serialized to the corresponding value. This can be useful since some APIs expect a `'true'` or `'false'` value as boolean, and requests serialises `True` to `'True'` and `False` to `'False'`. Set it to `None` to restore default requests behaviour.
        **kwargs: additional kwargs to configure this session. This parameter may be overridden at request time.

        You can also pass an iterable of path parts as relative url, which will be properly joined with "/". Those parts may be

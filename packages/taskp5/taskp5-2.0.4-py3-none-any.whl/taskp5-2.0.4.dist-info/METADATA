Create a log parser based on Regex. For test reasons utilize the access.log file.
The format of the access.log file is as follows: 
LogFormat "%h (%{X-Forwarded-For}i) %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b %T %D \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{UserAgent}i\" \"%{BALANCER_WORKER_NAME}e\""
Parse the Apache Tomcat access.log file and display the necessary records:

## Implementation

[Log_Parser](https://pypi.org/project/task4/)[![/^](https://gitlab.com/EPAM-DevOpsInt2023/devops-7-assets/-/raw/45ed5458fe7cf837b62a423fcdff6a52b8db3cdb/shared/images/external-link-blue-12.png)](https://pypi.org/project/task4/)
is a Python package that could be added to your global or virtual environment by preferable package manager pip, pipenv, poetry, etc.
The project itself was managed and built using the [Poetry library](https://python-poetry.org/)[![/^](https://gitlab.com/EPAM-DevOpsInt2023/devops-7-assets/-/raw/45ed5458fe7cf837b62a423fcdff6a52b8db3cdb/shared/images/external-link-blue-12.png)](https://python-poetry.org/),
so if you intend to clone this repo and make some changes for your own purposes, please install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)[![/^](https://gitlab.com/EPAM-DevOpsInt2023/devops-7-assets/-/raw/45ed5458fe7cf837b62a423fcdff6a52b8db3cdb/shared/images/external-link-blue-12.png)](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
or migrate to your preferred package management library.

Based on the need to build and the possibility of using both the library and the CLI, the code was split into a library for importing and a script for execution
via the command line. Additionally, the package contains a showcase that demonstrates all use cases when run through the command line.

To enhance the command line's functionality and expand showcase capabilities, the [Questionary](https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)[![/^](https://gitlab.com/EPAM-DevOpsInt2023/devops-7-assets/-/raw/45ed5458fe7cf837b62a423fcdff6a52b8db3cdb/shared/images/external-link-blue-12.png)](https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
library is used and will be installed through a dependency link upon package installation.

## Installation

Use your preferred installation method via different package installation managers to install Log_Parser.

###### Pip

To install Log_Parser packet to your environment using pip manager invoke `pip install task4`.

```bash
$ pip install task4

```

To uninstall Log Parser from your environment invoke `pip uninstall task4`.
It's important to note that the pip manager does not uninstall dependent packages. Therefore, if you wish to remove them, you'll need to take
the initiative and perform the task yourself. You can do this by using the commands `pip uninstall questionary prompt-toolkit wcwidth`.

###### Poetry

To install Log Parser packet to your environment using poetry manager invoke `poetry add task4`.

```bash
$ poetry add task4
Using version ^1.0.N for task4

  • Installing wcwidth (0.2.6)
  • Installing prompt-toolkit (3.0.39)
  • Installing questionary (1.10.0)

Writing lock file
```

By taking this action, a new dependency line will be added to your pyproject.toml file.

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
task4 = "^1.0.N"
```

To uninstall Log Parser from your environment invoke `poetry remove task4`.
One of the benefits of utilizing Poetry is that it allows for the removal of all dependent packages with a single command.

## Usage

There are various ways to use this library, as mentioned earlier.
- Utilize it like a library you can just import it into your .py file and use LogHelper class within your code.
- Utilize CLI via the command shell, either as a Python module or as a standalone command.
- Utilize CLI command in a pipe by passing stdout of other commands to the stdin of the log_parser command, writing stdout and stderr to files, or passing them to following commands.
- The library also contains rich showcase command that allows you to test all the use cases and even perform them in batches.


### Library

Below is a code snippet that demonstrates how to be able to use the log_parser library in your code.

```python
from log_parser.log_parser import logger, LogHandler
import re

with open('access.log', 'r') as f:
  handler = LogHandler(log=f,
                       extractor=re.compile(extractor, flags=re.I | re.X),
                       selection=selection,
                       aggregation=aggregation,
                       filter_str=filter_str,
                       rows=rows)

print(handler.output)

```

### CLI

The CLI interface has a single command called "log_parser". It can be invoked using two methods: `python3 -m log_parser` or simply `log_parser`.
Log_parser accepts various arguments, which are described below.

```text
log_parser [-h] [--version] -e  [-s] [-a] [-f] [-r [INDEXES ...]] [-v] [file_name]

positional arguments:
  file_name             An input filename

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -e , --extractor      Specify a regular expression for extracting certain data from each log line. 
                        The following expression patterns can be used to make      
                        writing an expression easier and reduce its size. 
                        For instance, "IP4\ \((?P<IP4_LIST>(?:(?:IP4|.*?),\ )*)(?:IP4|.*?)\)\ -\ -\
                        \[DATE_TIME_SEC\]\ \"(?:REQUEST|-)\"" 
                        
                        IP4_OCTET, MASK_OCTET, IP4, IP4_CIDR, MASK, IP6, IP6_CIDR, MAC_PART, MAC, VERSION, AGENT_AGENT,   
                        AGENT_OS, AGENT_DEVICE, AGENT_BROWSER, USER_AGENT, DOMAIN, EMAIL_NAME_CHARSET, EMAIL, URI, URL, 
                        REQUEST_TYPES, REQUEST, DATE_TIME_SEC, UUID
  -s , --selection      Specify a regular expression template to output selected data. To add previously extracted data
                        via regular expression groups use template group naming like \g<group_name>. 
                        It is allowed to use various transformation functions for substitution, extracting and even  
                        splitting data.
                        For instance, 
                        "TO_MIN(\g<DATE_TIME>) \g<URL>" or "SPLIT(RE('(?<=\().+?(?=\))', \g<IP4>), ',\ ')" 
                        
                        The list of possible functions: MIN, MAX, SPLIT, SUB, INTERVAL, SUM, COUNT, RE
  -a , --aggregation    The aggregate to be calculated during log parsing. It is used for sorting or summation.
                        For instance, "MAX(\g<STATUS>,5)" or ..... 
                        
                        The list of possible functions: MIN, MAX, SPLIT, SUB, INTERVAL, SUM, COUNT, RE
  -f , --filter         Specify a regular expression for filtering each line. It is supposed to used RE functions
                        and group naming like \g<group_name>. If the result of using regular expression return None
                        the line will be omitted. 
                        
                        For instance, 
                        "RE('50\d', \g<STATUS>)" or "RE((?:/+[a-z\d\-._~%&\'()*+,;=:@{\'}{\'}]+){2}, \g<REQUEST_PATH>)"
  -r [INDEXES ...], --rows [INDEXES ...]
                        The row range from the log file to be parsed. You can pass values in the following formats: particular indexes: index1 index2 ...       
                        indexN range of indexes: index1-index2 from the beginning up to index: -index from index to the end: index-
  -v                    Increase verbosity level (add more v)
```

To handle the arguments, the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)[![/^](https://gitlab.com/EPAM-DevOpsInt2023/devops-7-assets/-/raw/45ed5458fe7cf837b62a423fcdff6a52b8db3cdb/shared/images/external-link-blue-12.png)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
module is used. If you are already acquainted with it, you will have no difficulty in passing the arguments along with their values and comprehending their behavior.

The examples in a more convenient form you could find in the [showcase](#showcase).

### Pipes and files

The log_parser command could be used inside the pipe of the BASH commands. It can be used in various ways within a pipeline:
- receiving input
- direct output to a file
- direct logging also to a file

This command isn't intended for use in pipe sequence due to the table output format but is allowed.

### Showcase

To showcase the behavior of the log_parser library, an interactive command called "log_parser_showcase" has been created.
This command utilizes both the log_parser CLI and the log_parser library. It's an interactive command you can invoke via `log_parser_showcase` or `python3 -m log_parser.showcase`.
It has an optional flag that allows you to view all use cases at once without any interaction.
You can use the command `log_parser_showcase --all` to activate this feature.
There are also a ready-made Apache Tomcat log file presents - `access.log`.
You can use the showcase to test your own regular expressions and regular expression templates.

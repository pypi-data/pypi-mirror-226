> Python package for performing quality control (QC) for data coordination (DC)

This Python package provides a framework for performing quality control (QC) on data files. Quality control can range from low-level integrity checks (_e.g._ MD5 checksum, file extension) to high-level checks such as conformance to a format specification and consistency with associated metadata.

Early versions of this package were developed to be used by its sibling, the [nf-dcqc](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks-Workflows/nf-dcqc) Nextflow workflow. You can see examples of how to leverage py-dcqc there. Note that the initial command-line interface (CLI) was developed with nf-dcqc in mind, so smaller steps were favored to enable parallelism in Nextflow. Future iterations of this package will include user-friendly, high-level CLI commands.

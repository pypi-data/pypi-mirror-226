  abstract = {The human cerebral cortex has tremendous cellular diversity. How different cell types are organized in the human cortex and how cellular organization varies across species remain unclear. In this study, we performed spatially resolved single-cell profiling of 4000 genes using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), identified more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, and generated a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the human middle and superior temporal gyrus. We further explored cell-cell interactions arising from soma contact or proximity in a cell typeâ€“specific manner. Comparison of the human and mouse cortices showed conservation in the laminar organization of cells and differences in somatic interactions across species. Our data revealed human-specific cell-cell proximity patterns and a markedly increased enrichment for interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the human cortex.},

	abstract = {The Spatial Molecular Imaging platform (CosMxTM SMI, NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) utilizes high-plex in-situ imaging chemistry for both RNA and protein detection. This automated instrument provides 1000{\textquoteright}s of plex, at high sensitivity (1 to 2 copies/cell), very low error rate (0.0092 false calls/cell) and background (\~{}0.04 counts/cell). The imaging system generates three-dimensional super-resolution localization of analytes at \~{}2 million cells per sample, four samples per run. Cell segmentation is morphology-based using antibodies, compatible with FFPE samples. Multiomic data (980 RNAs, 108 proteins) were measured at subcellular resolution using FFPE tissues (non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and breast cancer) and allowed identification of over 18 distinct cell types, 10 unique tumor microenvironments, and 100 pairwise ligand-receptor interactions. Over 800,000 single cells and \~{}260 million transcripts data are released into the public domain allowing extended data analysis by the entire spatial biology research community.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of NanoString Technologies Inc. and hold NanoString stock or stock options.

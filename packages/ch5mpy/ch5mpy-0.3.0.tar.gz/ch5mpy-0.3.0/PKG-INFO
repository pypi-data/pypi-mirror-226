License: CeCILL-B FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
        
        
            Notice
        
        This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
        of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
        the two main principles guiding its drafting:
        
            * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
              of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
              users,
            * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
              it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
              intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
              both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
        
        The authors of the CeCILL-B (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre])
        license are:
        
        Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical
        and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of
        business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.
        
        Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
        and technological establishment, having its principal place of business
        at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.
        
        Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique -

        principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP
        105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France.
        
        
            Preamble
        
        This Agreement is an open source software license intended to give users
        significant freedom to modify and redistribute the software licensed
        hereunder.
        
        The exercising of this freedom is conditional upon a strong obligation
        of giving credits for everybody that distributes a software
        incorporating a software ruled by the current license so as all
        contributions to be properly identified and acknowledged.
        
        In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
        modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
        with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
        economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
        
        In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
        and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
        the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
        complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
        developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
        knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
        suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
        enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
        more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
        security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
        provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
        removed herefrom.
        
        This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
        the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

        Besides, if the Licensor owns or comes to own one or more patents
        protecting all or part of the functions of the Software or of its
        components, the Licensor undertakes not to enforce the rights granted by
        these patents against successive Licensees using, exploiting or
        modifying the Software. If these patents are transferred, the Licensor
        undertakes to have the transferees subscribe to the obligations set
        forth in this paragraph.
        
        
              5.1 RIGHT OF USE
        
        The Licensee is authorized to use the Software, without any limitation
        as to its fields of application, with it being hereinafter specified
        that this comprises:
        
           1. permanent or temporary reproduction of all or part of the Software

              or storage operation as regards the Software, that it is entitled
              to carry out hereunder.
        
        
              5.2 ENTITLEMENT TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS
        
        The right to make Contributions includes the right to translate, adapt,
        arrange, or make any or all modifications to the Software, and the right
        to reproduce the resulting software.

        In particular, the right of distribution includes the right to publish,
        transmit and communicate the Software to the general public on any or
        all medium, and by any or all means, and the right to market, either in
        consideration of a fee, or free of charge, one or more copies of the
        Software by any means.
        
        The Licensee is further authorized to distribute copies of the modified
        or unmodified Software to third parties according to the terms and

                5.3.2 DISTRIBUTION OF MODIFIED SOFTWARE
        
        If the Licensee makes any Contribution to the Software, the resulting
        Modified Software may be distributed under a license agreement other
        than this Agreement subject to compliance with the provisions of Article
        5.3.4.
        
        
                5.3.3 DISTRIBUTION OF EXTERNAL MODULES
        
        When the Licensee has developed an External Module, the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement do not apply to said External Module, that
        may be distributed under a separate license agreement.
        
        
                5.3.4 CREDITS
        
        Any Licensee who may distribute a Modified Software hereby expressly
        agrees to:
        
           1. indicate in the related documentation that it is based on the
              Software licensed hereunder, and reproduce the intellectual
              property notice for the Software,
        
           2. ensure that written indications of the Software intended use,
              intellectual property notice and license hereunder are included in

           3. mention, on a freely accessible website describing the Modified
              Software, at least throughout the distribution term thereof, that
              it is based on the Software licensed hereunder, and reproduce the
              Software intellectual property notice,
        
           4. where it is distributed to a third party that may distribute a
              Modified Software without having to make its source code
              available, make its best efforts to ensure that said third party
              agrees to comply with the obligations set forth in this Article .
        
        If the Software, whether or not modified, is distributed with an
        External Module designed for use in connection with the Software, the
        Licensee shall submit said External Module to the foregoing obligations.
        
        
                5.3.5 COMPATIBILITY WITH THE CeCILL AND CeCILL-C LICENSES
        
        Where a Modified Software contains a Contribution subject to the CeCILL
        license, the provisions set forth in Article 5.3.4 shall be optional.
        
        A Modified Software may be distributed under the CeCILL-C license. In
        such a case the provisions set forth in Article 5.3.4 shall be optional.
        
        
            Article 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
        
        
              6.1 OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE
        
        The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or
        all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms
        and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work
        and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the
        distribution of said Initial Software.
        
        The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at
        least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2.
        
        
              6.2 OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS
        
        The Licensee who develops a Contribution is the owner of the
        intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by
        applicable law.
        
        
              6.3 OVER THE EXTERNAL MODULES
        
        The Licensee who develops an External Module is the owner of the
        intellectual property rights over this External Module as defined by
        applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall
        govern its distribution.
        
        
              6.4 JOINT PROVISIONS
        
        The Licensee expressly undertakes:
        
           1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property
              notices attached to the Software;
        
           2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies
              of the Software modified or not.
        
        The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the
        intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the
        Software and to take, where applicable, vis-à-vis its staff, any and all
        measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights
        of the Holder and/or Contributors.
        
        
            Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES
        
        7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
        provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.
        
        However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
        terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
        maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
        Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
        shall incur liability therefor.
        
        7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
        its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
        itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
        Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
        warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
        shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
        and the Licensee.
        
        
            Article 8 - LIABILITY
        
        8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
        entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
        from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
        Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.
        
        8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
        this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
        (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
        obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
        Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
        generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
        agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
        loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
        opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
        legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
        shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
        any or all compensation from the Licensor.
        
        
            Article 9 - WARRANTY
        
        9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
        state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
        possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
        possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
        attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
        modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
        reserved for experienced users.
        
        The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
        the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
        order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
        or properties.
        
        9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
        to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
        rights set forth in Article 5).
        
        9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
        the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
        that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
        as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
        nature.
        
        Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
        from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
        be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
        configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
        
        9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
        Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
        relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
        the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
        arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
        instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
        Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
        the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
        assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
        decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
        Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
        disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
        name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
        prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
        of a trademark.
        
        
            Article 10 - TERMINATION
        
        10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
        hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
        thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
        remained ineffective.
        
        10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
        authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
        licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
        shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
        with the terms and conditions hereof.
        
        
            Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS
        
        
              11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS
        
        Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to
        perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force

# Ch5mpy

Pronounced "champy".
This library provides a set of helper tools for easily reading or writing even complex objects to h5 files using the h5py library. It implements wrappers around h5py objects providing APIs identical to regular Python lists and dicts and to numpy ndarrays.

See the complete documentation at https://ch5mpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for more details.

## Description

Ch5mpy provides a set of abstractions over h5py's (https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/) objects for handling them as more commonly used objects :
- H5Dict: an object behaving as regular Python dictionaries, for exploring Files and Groups.
- H5List: an object behaving as regular Python lists for storing any set of objects.
- H5Array: an object behaving as Numpy ndarrays for dealing effortlessly with Datasets while keeping the memory usage low. This works by applying numpy functions to small chunks of the whole Dataset at a time.
- AttributeManager: a dict-like object for accessing an h5 object's metadata.
- read/write utily functions for effortlessly storing any object to an h5 file.

Pickling has also been added to base h5 objects.

### Pickling
Ch5mpy provides Datasets, Groups and Files objects wrapping the h5py's equivalents to allow pickling. Those objects can be directly imported from `ch5mpy`:

```python
>>> from ch5mpy import File
>>> from ch5mpy import Group
>>> from ch5mpy import Dataset
```

The `H5Mode` enum lists valid modes for opening an h5 file:

```python
>>> from ch5mpy import H5Mode
```

```python
class H5Mode(str, Enum):
    READ = "r"  # Readonly, file must exist
    READ_WRITE = "r+"  # Read/write, file must exist
    WRITE_TRUNCATE = "w"  # Create file, truncate if exists
    WRITE = "w-"  # Create file, fail if exists
    READ_WRITE_CREATE = "a"  # Read/write if exists, create otherwise
```

### Attributes
Metadata on Datasets, Groups and Files can be obtained and modified through the `.attrs` attribute, returning an `AttributeManager` object. `AttributeManagers` behave like Python dictionaries for getting and setting any value.

```python
>>> from ch5mpy import File
>>> f = File('some/file.h5')
>>> f.attrs
AttributeManager{value: 1,
                 creation: '02/08/2021',
                 parent: None}
>>> f.attrs['value']
1
```

`AttributeManagers` correctly handle `None` values.

### H5Dict
An `H5Dict` allows to explore the content of an H5 File or Group as if it was a regular Python dict. Any value can be set in an `H5Dict`. However, keys in an `H5Dict` are not loaded into memory until they are directly requested. `Datasets` are wrapped and accessed as `H5Arrays` (see section [H5Arrays](#h5array)).

To create an `H5Dict`, a `File` or `Group` object must be provided as argument:

```python
>>> from ch5mpy import File
>>> from ch5mpy import H5Dict
>>> from ch5mpy import H5Mode
>>>
>>> dct = H5Dict(File("dict.h5", H5Mode.READ_WRITE))
>>> dct
H5Dict{
    a: 1, 
    b: H5Array([1, 2, 3], shape=(3,), dtype=int64), 
    c: {...}
}
```

Here, `dct` is an `H5Dict` with 3 keys `a, b and c` where :
- `a` maps to the value `1`
- `b` maps to a 1D Dataset 
- `c` maps to a sub H5Dict with keys and values not loaded yet

Alternatively, an `H5Dict` can be created directly from a path to an h5 file:

```python
>>> H5Dict.read("dict.h5")
H5Dict{
    a: 1, 
    b: H5Array([1, 2, 3], shape=(3,), dtype=int64), 
    c: {...}
}
```

### H5List
An `H5List` behave as regular Python lists, allowing to store and access any kind of object in an h5 file. `H5Lists` are usually created when regular lists are stored in an h5 file. 

As for [H5Dicts](#h5dict), `H5Lists` can be created by providing a `File` or by calling the `.read()` method:

```python
>>> from ch5mpy import File
>>> from ch5mpy import H5List
>>> from ch5mpy import H5Mode
>>>
>>> lst = H5List(File("backed_list.h5", H5Mode.READ_WRITE))
>>> lst
H5List[1.0, 2, '4.']
```

```python
class O_:
    def __init__(self, v: float):
        self._v = v

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"O({self._v})"
```

```python
>>> lst.append(O(5.0))
>>> lst
H5List[1.0, 2, '4.', O(5.0)]
```

`H5Lists` can store regular integers, floats and strings, but can also store any object (such as the `O` object at index 3 in this example).

### H5Array
`H5Arrays` wrap `Datasets` and implement numpy ndarrays' interface to behave as numpy ndarrays while controlling the amount of RAM used. The maximum amount of available RAM for performing operations can be set with the function `set_options(max_memory_usage=...)`, using suffixes `B`, `K`, `M` and `G` for expressing amounts in bytes.

H5Arrays can be created by passing a `Dataset` as argument. 

```python
>>> from ch5mpy import File
>>> from ch5mpy import H5Mode
>>> from ch5mpy import H5Array
>>> h5_array = H5Array(File("h5_arrays", H5Mode.READ_WRITE)["integers"])
>>> h5_array
H5Array([[0, 1, 2],
         [3, 4, 5],
         [6, 7, 8]], shape=(3, 3), dtype=int64)
>>> h5_array = H5Array(File("h5_arrays", H5Mode.READ_WRITE)["strings"])
>>> h5_array
H5Array(['blue', 'red', 'yellow'], shape=(3,), dtype='<U6')
```



Then, all usual numpy indexing and methods can be used. To keep the memory footprint small, those methods will be applied repeatedly on small chunks of the underlying Dataset.

To load an H5Array into memory as a numpy array, simply run :

```python
np.array(h5_array)
```

### Read/write utilities

#### Functions
To store any array-like object (object which could be converted to a numpy ndarray), functions `write_dataset()` and `write_datasets()` respectively allow to store one or many such objects.

To store any other object, call functions `write_object()` and `write_objects()`. 
To dertermine how the object will be stored in the h5 file, the following rules are applied:
- objects implementing the [Storing API](#storing-api) will be stored by calling the `__h5_write__()` function
- objects that can be converted to numpy arrays will be saved by calling `write_dataset()`
- numbers and strings will be stored directly 
- all other objects will be stored as binary data by first pickling them

#### Storing API
To define by hand how an object is stored and read from an h5 file, you can implement the `__h5_write__()` and `__h5_read__()` methods:

```python
class YourObject:
    ...

    def __h5_write__(self, values: ch5mpy.H5Dict[Any]) -> None: 
        ...

    @classmethod
    def __h5_read__(cls, values: ch5mpy.H5Dict[Any]) -> YourObject:
        ...
```

Both `__h5_write__()` and `__h5_read__()` receive as input an `H5Dict` in which to store or retreive your object. Please note that `__h5_read__()` is a classmethod, called as `YourObject.__h5_read__()` and which is responsible for both reading data from the `H5Dict` and reconstructing an instance of `YourObject`.

## About <a name = "about"></a>
A target agnostic translator for Agents Assembly. The translator can be tested live on [Agents Assembly website](https://agents-assembly.com/translator).
It is a part of the [Agents Assembly](https://agents-assembly.com) ecosystem.
Other applications are:
- [Local Interface](https://github.com/agent-based-information-flow-simulation/local-interface) - GUI for simulation definition, management, and analysis.
- [Simulation Run Environment](https://github.com/agent-based-information-flow-simulation/simulation-run-environment) - environment for running scalable agent-based simulations.
- [Communication Server](https://github.com/agent-based-information-flow-simulation/communication-server) - cluster of servers used for XMPP communication.
- [Local Development Environment](https://github.com/agent-based-information-flow-simulation/local-development-environment) - simple environment for running agent-based simulations.

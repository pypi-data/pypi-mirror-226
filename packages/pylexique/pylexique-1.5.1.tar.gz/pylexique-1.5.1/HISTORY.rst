1.2.3 (2021-05-04)
------------------

1.2.1 (2021-04-30)
------------------

* Implemented Type Hinting for main module.
* Added a new method to the class Lexique383. The method is Lexique383._save_errors() .

* Expanded sample usage of the software in the docs.
* Much better documentation including links to Lexique383 pages and manuals.

1.2.0 (2021-04-30)
------------------

* Added a new method to the class Lexique383. The method is Lexique383.get_lex() .
* This new method accepts either a single word as a string or an iterable of strings and will return the asked lexical information.
* Expanded sample usage of the software in the docs.
* Substantial update to the code and docs.
* Removed unneeded dependencies as I reimplement some functionality myself.

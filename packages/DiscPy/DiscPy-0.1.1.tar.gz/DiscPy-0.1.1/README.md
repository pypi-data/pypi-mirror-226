# DiscPy

A python wrapper for the Discuit API.

Currently, only capable of returning existing information, as authentication is yet to be implemented.

## Basic usage:
```
from DiscPy.disc_api import DiscuitAPI 
api = DiscuitAPI()
api.get_all_posts()
````


## **Methods:**

### Authentication
```
api.authenticate(username, password)
```
Currently not working.


### Posts
```
api.get_all_posts()
```
Returns a list of post objects (as seen on discuit.com/home)

```
api.get_post_by_id(post_id)
```
Returns a post object by public ID.

```
api.get_post_comments(post_id)
```
Returns a list of comment objects by public post ID.

### Community
```
api.get_communites()
```
Returns a list of all communities as community objects.

```
api.get_community_by_id(id)
```
Returns a community object by ID. 
(TODO - add by name)

```
api.get_community_rules(community_id)
```
Returns a list of Rule objects by community ID.

```
api.get_community_mods(community_id)
```
Returns a list of User objects who moderate the community

```
api.get_community_posts(community_id)
```

### User

```
api.get_user_by_username(username)
```
Returns a user object by username.

## Objects

These are taken from the documentation supplied by Previnder. My implementation is snake case, e.g. email_confirmed_at, rather than CamelCase.

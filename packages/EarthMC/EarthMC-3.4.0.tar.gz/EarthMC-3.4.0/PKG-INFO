## Official API
Similarly to the [EarthMC NPM](https://github.com/EarthMC-Toolkit/EarthMC-NPM) library, 
it is possible to send calls to EarthMC's [Official API](https://earthmc.net/docs/api).<br>
This includes Towny data like balances, timestamps, perms, ranks and more.

```py
from EarthMC import OfficialAPI

town = OfficialAPI.town('venice')
nation = OfficialAPI.nation('venice')
player = OfficialAPI.player('fix') 
```

# `AutoRequirements`: A Python package for making requirements.txt automatically

I saw there was not a singular good way to automatically make a correct requirements.txt that wouldnt fail, so I made it myself, while restricting myself to only use the standard included packages.



The code is not that well written, but it is fast enough.



Run the program in the folder of your program with 

```shell
AutoRequirements
```

"""

A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.
Any assignment to a variable or function call is a statement
 e.g while statements, for statements, if statements, and import statements.

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.
Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression,
the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.

Any value is an expression! Anything that does something is a statement.

Expressions are nothing but values, except they can have operations like addition or subtraction.
eval evaluates the string as if it were a python expression.

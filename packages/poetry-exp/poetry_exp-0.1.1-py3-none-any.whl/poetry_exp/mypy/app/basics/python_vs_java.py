Python is less verbos and simple as compared to Java
Java is static type language where as python Dynamic Type
Python execution speed is slow as compared to java as it has to evolute type information at runtime
Python takes more memory than java
Java has strong database access than python

Java is platform independent, but python not for all


in projects where speed is the main component, you should go for Java
An example of such a project is where you may need to retrieve data from a database.
So if you ask Python or Java as far as speed is concerned, Java wins.

Python language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as
string processing like regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files,
Internet protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP,
CGI programming, software engineering like unit testing,
logging, profiling, parsing Python code,
and operating system interfaces like system calls, file systems, TCP/IP sockets.

Here is the summary for in:

list, touple - Average: O(n)
set/dict - Average: O(1), Worst: O(n)
The O(n) worst case for sets and dicts is very uncommon,
but can happen if __hash__ is implemented poorly.
This only happens if everything in your set has the same hash value.


Time complexity of sort method of python is nlogn
Best case O(n)
Average case O(nlogn)
Worst case O(nlogn)

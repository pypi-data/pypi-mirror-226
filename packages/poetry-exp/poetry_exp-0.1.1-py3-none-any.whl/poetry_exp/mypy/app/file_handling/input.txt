The script should be a general script that works on any file supplied with the format of input.txt.

The script should be run like this:

cat input.txt | python script.py > output.txt

[-- input.txt is below --]

* This is an outline

. It's not a very good outline

.. I've seen better

.. I've seen worse

* This is the second numbered item in the outline

. This is sub text that spans multiple lines

This should be included with the previous line

And this line too

.. That is more sub text

* Numbers

. Some text

** Lots

. Some more text

. And some more

*** And lots

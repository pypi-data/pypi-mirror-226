FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on
standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.

Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.

Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.

Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.


Kubernates:
It is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment,
scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained
by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
The Kubernetes Project was open-sourced by Google in 2014 after using it to run production workloads at scale
for more than a decade.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery

Helm:
Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even
the most complex Kubernetes application. Helm is a graduated project in the CNCF
(Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and is maintained by the Helm community.

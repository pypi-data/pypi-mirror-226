I want you to create a method to increment a number. The number can be any number, but it will be given as an array of digits.
The output also should be an array, which is the number incremented. I want to see array handling logic, so dont
 do x*100 + y*10 - or converting to string (and then to number) etc
Def incr([2,3,4]) =>as good as incr(234) => 235 => [2,3,5]
Def incr([3,4,2,5]) =>as good as incr(3425) => Result: 3426 => [3,4,2,6]

234, 3425, 239, 299
Def incr(arr):
     Sum = sum(arr)

     N = len(arr)-1
     arr[N] = arr[N]+1
    Return arr

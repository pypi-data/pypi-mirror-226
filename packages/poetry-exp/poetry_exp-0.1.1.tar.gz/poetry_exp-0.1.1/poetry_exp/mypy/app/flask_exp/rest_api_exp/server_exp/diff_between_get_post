When the method is GET, all form data is encoded into the URL, appended to the action URL as query string parameters.
With POST, form data appears within the message body of the HTTP request.

In GET method, the parameter data is limited to what we can stuff into the request line (URL).
Safest to use less than 2K of parameters, some servers handle up to 64K.
No such problem in POST method since we send data in message body of the HTTP request, not the URL.

Only ASCII characters are allowed for data to be sent in GET method.There is no such restriction in POST method.
GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL.
So, GET method should not be used when sending passwords or other sensitive information.

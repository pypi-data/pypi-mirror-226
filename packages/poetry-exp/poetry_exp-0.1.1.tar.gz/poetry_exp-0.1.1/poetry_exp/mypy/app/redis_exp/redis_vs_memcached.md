Memcached is a distributed memory caching system designed for ease of use and simplicity and
is well-suited as a cache or a session store.

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that offers a rich set of features.
It is useful as a cache, database, message broker, and queue

Memcached is a solid choice for solving simple caching problems. However,
generally speaking, Redis outperforms Memcached by offering richer functionality and
various features that are promising for complex use-cases.

**Data Partitioning and Scalling**
Similarly, both in-memory databases allow distributing data across multiple nodes.
Both caching solutions offer high scalability to handle large data when demand grows exponentially.


**Data Structures**
Memcached stores key-value pairs as a String and has a 1MB size limit per value.
However, Redis also supports other data structures like list, set, and hash,
and can store values of up to 512MB in size.


**Memory Usage:**
Memcached has a higher memory utilization rate than Redis when comparing the String data structure.
In spite of that, when Redis uses the hash structure, it provides
a higher memory utilization rate than Memcached.

**Architecture**
Redis uses a single core and shows better performance than Memcached in storing
small datasets when measured in terms of cores.

Memcached implements a multi-threaded architecture by utilizing multiple cores.
Therefore, for storing larger datasets, Memcached can perform better than Redis.

Another benefit of Memcached's multi-threaded architecture is its high scalability,
achieved by utilizing multiple computational resources.

Redis can scale horizontally via clustering, which is comparatively more complex
to set up and operate. Also, we can use Jedis or Lettuce to enable
a Redis cluster using a Java application.


**Publish and Subscribe Messaging**
Memcached doesn't support publish/subscribe messaging out-of-the-box.

Redis, on the other hand, provides functionality to publish and subscribe
to messages using pub/sub message queues.

This can be useful when designing applications that require real-time
communication like chat rooms, social media feeds, and server intercommunication.


**Transactions**
Memcached doesn't support transactions, although its operations are atomic.

Redis provides out-of-the-box support for transactions to execute commands.

We can start the transaction using the MULTI command. Then, we can use the EXEC
command for the execution of the following subsequent commands.
Finally, Redis provides the WATCH command for the conditional execution of the transaction.

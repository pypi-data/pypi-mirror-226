"""
List objects are mutable objects, Tuple objects are immutable Objects
List cant be used as a key for the dictionary,
Tuple can be used as a key for the dictionary if the tuple is storing only immutable elements

Applying iterations on list objects takes longer time,
Applying iterations on tuple Objects takes less time

If the frequent operation is insertion or deletion of the elements then it is recommended to use list
If the frequent operation is retrieval of the elements then it is recommended to use tuple

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# prompt2model

## What is this?

`Prompt2model` is a powerful package designed
to streamline the process of creating models
based on prompts indicating a task for OpenAI
models such as ChatGPT
or GPT-4. This package takes a prompt
as input and leverages it to generate a model
that can effectively solve the task described
in the prompt. With `prompt2model`, you can
easily convert your prompts into functional
models, making it easier to utilize the
power of general OpenAI LLMs in your projects.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies,
run the following command in your terminal
to install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Configuration

Before using `prompt2model`, there is a
few configuration steps you need to complete:

- Sign up on the OpenAI website and obtain an
OpenAI API key.

- Provide OpenAI API key in the
initialization function of the classes which
requires calling OpenAI Models.

- Alternatively, you can set
the environment variable
`OPENAI_API_KEY` to your API key by running
the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
```

- After setting the environment
Variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, just
reference  load it in your Python:

```python
import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
```

To enable the model retriever, we need to untar the model_info.tgz file:

```bash
cd huggingface_models
tar -xvf model_info.tgz
```

## Components

The `prompt2model` package is composed
of several components, each designed
to fulfill a specific purpose. To gain
a comprehensive understanding of how to
utilize each component effectively,
please consult the `readme.md` file
situated in the directory of the respective
component. These files can be found at
`./prompt2model/<component>/readme.md`.
They provide detailed information and
instructions on maximizing the
functionality and benefits of each
component within the package.

## Usage

The `prompt2model` pipeline is a versatile
pipeline for task solving using a language
model. It covers stages including dataset retrieval,
generation, processing, model retrieval,
training, execution, evaluation, and
interface creation. The
`.cli_demo.py`
By directly run `python cli_demo.py`,
users can efficiently
leverage language models for various tasks
by customizing the components according to
their specific requirements.

## How to Write a Good Prompt

A good prompt can make the generated dataset
follow exactly the format of demonstrations.
It contains the instruction and few-shot examples.

The instruction should contain the following:

1. The exact format description for the input
and output, i.e., a string, a dictionary, or whatever.
2. The exact contents of each part of the
input and their relationship as possible as you can.
3. The range of possible input. For example,
"And the question can range from Math, Cultural,
Social, Geometry, Biology, History, Sports, Technology,
Science, and so on."

The few-shot examples should contain the following:

1. Use `=` rather than other ambiguous symbols like `:`.
2. Avoid unnecessary line breaks at the beginning.
For example, `input=""` is better than breaking
the line after `=`.
3. Use `input` rather than `Input`, `ouput` is
preferable likewise.
4. Warp the `input` and `output` into a string with `“”`.

Though the examples are optional, we strongly
suggest including them to guide the format and
content for the generator.

Also, we recommend providing several precise examples
in the specified format and inquiring with ChatGPT
about the format and scope of your examples.

## Customization

If you want to customize a specific component,
see the relevant doc page and class document string.

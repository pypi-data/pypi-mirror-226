ManiSkill2 is a unified benchmark for learning generalizable robotic manipulation skills powered by [SAPIEN](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/). **It features 20 out-of-box task families with 2000+ diverse object models and 4M+ demonstration frames**. Moreover, it empowers fast visual input learning algorithms so that **a CNN-based policy can collect samples at about 2000 FPS with 1 GPU and 16 processes on a workstation**. The benchmark can be used to study a wide range of algorithms: 2D & 3D vision-based reinforcement learning, imitation learning, sense-plan-act, etc.

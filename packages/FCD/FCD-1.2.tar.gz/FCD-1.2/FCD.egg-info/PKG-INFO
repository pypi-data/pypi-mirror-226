## Installation
You can install the FCD using
```
pip install fcd
```

# Requirements
```
numpy
torch
scipy
rdkit
```

# Updates
## Version 1.1 changes
- Got rid of unneeded imports
- `load_ref_model` doesn't need an argument any more to load a model.
- `canonical` and `canonical_smiles` now return `None` for invalid smiles.
- Added `get_fcd` as a quick way to get a the fcd score from two lists of smiles.

## Version 1.2 changes
- Ported the package to pytorch with the help of https://github.com/insilicomedicine/fcd_torch
- pytorch allows a lighter package and is more popular than Tensorflow which saves an additional install

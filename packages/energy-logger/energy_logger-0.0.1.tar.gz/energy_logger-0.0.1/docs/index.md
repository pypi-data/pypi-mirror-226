# Introduction

Energy Logger is a way to log 'energy inputs' to data outputs periodically. The inputs and outputs
are declared in the `config.toml` file. At least one input and one output should be present in the
configuration file.

Energy Logger can be run on its own, or included as a module in other projects.

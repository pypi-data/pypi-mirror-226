        This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as defined
        below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work,
        other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such
        use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).
        
        The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
        defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
        copyright notice for the Work:
        
                Licensed under the EUPL
        
        or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.
        
        1. Definitions
        
        In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:
        
        - ‘The Licence’: this Licence.
        
        - ‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the
          Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
          Code as the case may be.
        
        - ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the
          Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence
          does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work
          required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is
          determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.
        
        - ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.
        
        - ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
          convenient for people to study and modify.
        
        - ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
          meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.
        
        - ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates
          the Work under the Licence.
        
        - ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the
          Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.
        
        - ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of
          the Work under the terms of the Licence.
        
        - ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,
          renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
          available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
          essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
          person.
        
        2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence
        
        The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
        sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested
        in the Original Work:
        
        - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
        - reproduce the Work,
        - modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
        - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
          the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may
          be, the Work,
        - distribute the Work or copies thereof,
        - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
        - sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.
        
        Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
        known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.
        
        In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
        exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective
        the licence of the economic rights here above listed.
        
        The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights to
        any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the
        rights granted on the Work under this Licence.
        
        3. Communication of the Source Code
        
        The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
        Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
        provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
        along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in
        a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where
        the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor
        continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
        
        4. Limitations on copyright
        
        Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from
        any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the
        Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations
        thereto.
        
        5. Obligations of the Licensee
        
        The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
        obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
        
        Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
        trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
        disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a
        copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
        communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
        notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
        
        Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
        Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
        done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
        unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the
        Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee
        (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on
        the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.
        
        Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
        Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under
        a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the
        terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ‘Compatible
        Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence.
        Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with
        his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible
        Licence shall prevail.
        
        Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work,
        the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate
        a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long
        as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
        
        Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,
        trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for
        reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
        
        6. Chain of Authorship
        
        The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
        hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
        power and authority to grant the Licence.
        
        Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings
        to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
        power and authority to grant the Licence.
        
        Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
        Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
        terms of this Licence.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty
        
        The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
        Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
        ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.
        
        For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis
        and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
        limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects
        or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than
        copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
        
        This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition
        for the grant of any rights to the Work.
        
        8. Disclaimer of Liability
        
        Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
        persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
        material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use
        of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
        stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
        damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
        However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as
        far such laws apply to the Work.
        
        9. Additional agreements
        
        While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement,
        defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if
        accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
        responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor,
        and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
        for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by
        the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.
        
        10. Acceptance of the Licence
        
        The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I agree’
        placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by
        affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of
        applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
        acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
        
        Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
        conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence,
        such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the
        Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.
        
        11. Information to the public
        
        In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
        communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a
        remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must
        at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law
        regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded,
        stored and reproduced by the Licensee.
        
        12. Termination of the Licence
        
        The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
        any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.
        
        Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
        received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
        remain in full compliance with the Licence.

FlotteKarte
===========

**FlotteKarte** is a Python library for quick and versatile cartography
based on PROJ4-string syntax and using Matplotlib, NumPy, and PyPROJ under
the hood.

## Installing
The install system is based on the Meson build system and Python setuptools.
A typical install might be performed by executing the following command
within this project directory:
```sh
pip install --user .
```
At first import of `flottekarte`, the Meson build system will be invoked to
compile the backend. Similarly, whenever importing the backend fails (e.g. if
the system PROJ library was updated) the backend is recompiled. For this reason,
FlotteKarte needs to be installed with write permissions (i.e. user install).

### Requirements
The following software has to be installed:
 - PROJ
 - OpenMP
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib
 - PyProj
 - SciPy
 - Meson
 - Ninja

The following software will be automatically downloaded during Meson installation:
 - [ProjWrapCpp](https://github.com/mjziebarth/ProjWrapCpp)

### Recompiling the backend after an update to PROJ
If the system's PROJ library is updated, FlotteKarte might be linked to a
shared library that is no longer available on the system. Recompiling
FlotteKarte will be necessary. This will automatically be performed at
import time if a failure to load the shared library is detected.

For this reason, Meson and Ninja need to be available on the system if the
PROJ library that FlotteKarte is linked to changes.

If this package should be packaged for some system package manager, the file
`flottekarte/extensions/cdll.py` would have to be adjusted, see comments
therein.

## Usage
FlotteKarte is a low-overhead plotting routine. The conceptual idea behind this package
is that a map is fully defined through the 2D cartesian coordinates that result from applying the
map projection to different geographical data. For displaying data on a two-dimensional
canvas, Matplotlib is a powerful tool. Conversion between geographic and projected
coordinates can easily be done using PyProj. The gap between these two powerful tools
and a polished map lies in potential difficulties when translating spherical line topology
to 2D cartesian space, and by introducing typical map decorations such as grids or ticks.
FlotteKarte aims to fill this gap with a simple interface.

FlotteKarte's philosophy is to work completely within the 2D projected coordinates,
that is, very close to the projected data. If projected coordinates of data can be 
obtained, the data can be drawn directly on the underlying Matplotlib Axes. The
`Map` class can then be used to add typical map decoration to that axes using information
that it derives from the numerics of the PROJ projection.

The basic usage pattern is:
```python
# Given:
#   lon:      some longitudes
#   lat:      some latitudes of equal size
#   proj_str: A PROJ4 string

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from flottekarte import Map
from pyproj import Proj
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

# Project the data:
x,y = Proj(proj_str)(lon,lat)

# Create a map on axis 'ax' from the PROJ string.
# Alternative:
#    mp = Map(proj_str, ax, xlim, ylim)
# where xlim and ylim would be determined through x and y.
mp = Map.for_data(lon, lat, proj_str, ax)

# Scatter the data:
ax.scatter(x,y)
# ... and maybe some other here.

# Plot a grid with 5 degree spacing:
mp.plot_grid(5)

# Complete the plot by this call (ticks every 5 degrees).
mp.plot_axes(5)
```

### Example Map for Iceland
This code uses the file `testing/data/natura-learth/iceland.geojson` to show
the coast line of iceland and compute, in a stereographic projection, the
distance to shoreline:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from flottekarte import Map, GeoJSON
from pyproj import Proj
from scipy.spatial import KDTree

# The projection we will be working in:
proj_str = '+proj=stere +lon_0=-18 +lat_0=64.5'
proj = Proj(proj_str)

# Load the shoreline (this assumes the GeoJSON is
# in the same folder):
iceland = GeoJSON('iceland.geojson', proj_str)
xlim, ylim = iceland.get_extent()

# Extract the vertices from the PatchCollection:
iceland_xy = [patch.vertices for patch in
              iceland.get_polygon_patches()
                     .get_paths()][0]

# Interpolate the distance to the shoreline
# on a grid:
xg, yg = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(*xlim, 120),
                     np.linspace(*ylim, 80))
zg = np.empty(xg.shape)
tree = KDTree(iceland_xy)
zg.flat[...] = tree.query(np.stack((xg.flat, yg.flat),
                                   axis=1))[0]

# Compute the locations of local distance maxima:
maxima = np.zeros(zg.shape, dtype=bool)
maxima[1:-1,1:-1] =  (zg[:-2,1:-1] < zg[1:-1,1:-1]) \
                   & (zg[2:,1:-1] < zg[1:-1,1:-1]) \
                   & (zg[1:-1,:-2] < zg[1:-1,1:-1]) \
                   & (zg[1:-1,2:] < zg[1:-1,1:-1])
xmaxima = xg[maxima]
ymaxima = yg[maxima]

# Finally, after processing create the map:
fig = plt.figure(dpi=100, figsize=(12.80, 6.40))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
mp = Map(proj_str, ax, xlim, ylim, proj=proj)
mp.add_data(iceland, color='navajowhite')
ax.contour(xg, yg, zg, colors='k',
           linewidths=0.8)
ax.scatter(xmaxima, ymaxima, marker='.', color='k',
           s=5)
mp.plot_axes(2)
fig.savefig('iceland-example-map.png')
```
The map should look like the following:

### [0.2.0] - 2022-08-04
#### Added
- Added automatic extent computation for some global projections.
- Coordinate labels can be rotated with axis orientation.
- Add AugmentedProj class that automatically falls back to numerical inversion
  if a projection does not come with a defined inversion routine.

#### Changed
- Simplified detection of discontinuities in path processing.
- Reworked the map boundary. It can now follow non-rectangular map shapes
  as defined by violated bijectivity of the map projection.
- Reworked the axes labelling mechanism. Axes are removed if they overlapped,
  based on a weighting criterion, and the labels now follow the (potentially
  non-rectangular) map boundary polygon.
- Fix various bugs.

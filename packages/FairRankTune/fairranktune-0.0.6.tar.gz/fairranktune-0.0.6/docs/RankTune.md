# RankTune

## Overview
RankTune is a pseudo-stochastic data generation method for creating fairness-aware ranked lists using the fairness concept of statistical parity. Inlcuded in the ```RankTune``` module, it creates ranking(s) based on the ```phi``` representativeness parameter. When ```phi = 0``` then the generated ranked list(s) does not represent groups fairly, and as ```phi``` increases groups are represented more and more fairly; thus ```phi = 1``` groups are fairly represented. RankTune uses a [pseudo-random process](#how-does-it-work) to generate fairness-aware ranked data. RankTune can generate ranked data from [user provided group sizes](#using-group-sizes), from [existing datasets](#using-an-existing-dataset), along with [producing relevance scores](#generating-scores-with-the-ranking) accompanying the ranked list(s). 

## Usage
RankTune can be utilized through four function interfaces.
### Using Group Sizes
```RankTune``` can be used to generate ranking(s) from ```group_proportions```, a numpy array with each group's proportion of the total items,```num_items```, by using the ```GenFromGroups()``` function.

Usage:
```python title="GenFromGroups() function" hl_lines="12"
import FairRankTune as frt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from FairRankTune import RankTune, Metrics

#Generate a biased (phi = 0.1) ranking of 1000 items, with four groups of 100, 200, 300, and 400 items each.
group_proportions = np.asarray([.1, .2, .3, .4]) #Array of group proportions
num_items = 1000 #1000 items to be in the generated ranking
phi = 0.1
r_cnt = 1 #Generate 1 ranking
seed = 10 #For reproducability
ranking_df, item_group_dict = frt.RankTune.GenFromGroups(group_proportions, num_items, phi, r_cnt, seed)

#Calculate EXP with a MinMaxRatio
EXP_minmax, avg_exposures_minmax = frt.Metrics.EXP(ranking_df, item_group_dict, 'MinMaxRatio')
print("EXP of generated ranking: ", EXP_minmax, "avg_exposures: ", avg_exposures_minmax)
```

Output:
```python
EXP of generated ranking:  0.511665941043515 avg_exposures:  {0: 0.20498798214669187, 1: 0.13126425437156242, 2: 0.11461912123646827, 3: 0.10488536878769836}
```
Can confirm this is an unfair ranking by the low EXP value.

### Using an Existing Dataset

```RankTune``` can be used to generate ranking(s) from ```item_group_dict```, a dictionary of items where the keys are each item's group by using the ```GenFromItems()``` function.

Usage:
```python title="GenFromItems() function" hl_lines="11"
import FairRankTune as frt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from FairRankTune import RankTune, Metrics

#Generate a biased (phi = 0.1) ranking
item_group_dict = dict(Joe= "M",  David= "M", Bella= "W", Heidi= "W", Amy = "W", Jill= "W", Jane= "W", Dave= "M", Nancy= "W", Nick= "M")
phi = 0.1
r_cnt = 1 #Generate 1 ranking
seed = 10 #For reproducability
ranking_df, item_group_dict = frt.RankTune.GenFromItems(item_group_dict, phi, r_cnt, seed)

#Calculate EXP with a MinMaxRatio
EXP_minmax, avg_exposures_minmax = frt.Metrics.EXP(ranking_df, item_group_dict, 'MinMaxRatio')
print("Generated ranking: ", ranking_df)
print("EXP of generated ranking: ", EXP_minmax, "avg_exposures: ", avg_exposures_minmax)
```

Output:
```python
Generated ranking:         0
0   Nick
1   Dave
2  David
3    Joe
4  Nancy
5   Jane
6   Jill
7    Amy
8  Heidi
9  Bella
EXP of generated ranking:  0.5158099476966725 avg_exposures:  {'M': 0.6404015779112127, 'W': 0.33032550440724917}
```
We can confirm this is a biased ranking base don the low EXP score and large difference in average exposure between the 'M' and 'W' groups.

### Generating Scores With the Ranking

Both ```GenFromGroups()``` and ```GenFromItems()``` contain sibling functions; respectively, ```ScoredGenFromGroups()``` and ```ScoredGenFromItems()``` that also generate relevance scores alongside the produced ranking(s). Scores are generated from either a normal or uniform distribution by setting the ```score_dist``` parameter to either ```normal``` or ```uniform```.


For generating from group proportions use ```ScoredGenFromGroups()``` as follows:

```python title="ScoredGenFromGroups() function" hl_lines="13"
import FairRankTune as frt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from FairRankTune import RankTune, Metrics

#Generate a biased (phi = 0.1) ranking of 1000 items, with four groups of 100, 200, 300, and 400 items each.
group_proportions = np.asarray([.1, .2, .3, .4]) #Array of group proportions
num_items = 1000 #1000 items to be in the generated ranking
phi = 0.1
r_cnt = 1 #Generate 1 ranking
seed = 11 #For reproducability
score_dist = "uniform"
ranking_df, item_group_dict, scores_df = frt.RankTune.ScoredGenFromGroups(group_proportions, num_items, phi, r_cnt, score_dist, seed)

#Calculate EXP with a MinMaxRatio
EXP_minmax, avg_exposures_minmax = frt.Metrics.EXP(ranking_df, item_group_dict, 'MinMaxRatio')
print("EXP of generated ranking: ", EXP_minmax, "avg_exposures: ", avg_exposures_minmax)
```


Output:
```python
EXP of generated ranking:  0.5218433930014378 avg_exposures:  {0: 0.20212221456603452, 1: 0.13273063123258025, 2: 0.11380909457280128, 3: 0.10547614225010409}
```




## How does it work?

RankTune is a fairness-tunable  ranked data generation method. It constructs a ranking(s) ```ranking_df``` by placing items into the constructed ranking from top to bottom. The idea behind RankTune is that to construct a "fair" ranking, each time we place an item in the generated ranking, the likelihood of placing an item in a given group should be equal to that group's proportion of the total items (i.e., if a group is 20% of the item pool, then it should have a 20% chance of being placed). Then, on the other side of the spectrum, if we want a completely "unfair" ranking, we should place items into the rankings such that groups are ordered by increasing size from small to large. In this way, smaller groups  get bigger proportions of favorable positions, which violates statistical parity fairness. 

To generate rankings along the statistical parity fairness spectrum, RankTune samples a random number in the [0, 1] interval each time it places an item. We design this interval to have "regions" that map to groups. In this way, the unfairness tuning parameter ```phi``` controls representativeness, i.e.,  how fairly each group is represented in the ranking. Specifically, when ```phi = 1``` , then  each group is fairly represented. Thus each group's region is equal to the group's proportion of the pool (fair). As ```phi``` decreases, the fair representation of each group degrades because regions are distorted in such a way that smaller groups have larger regions compared to their proportion of the total pool (unfair). The fairness tuning parameter ```phi``` is used to create the regions prior to placing any items into the generated ranking.

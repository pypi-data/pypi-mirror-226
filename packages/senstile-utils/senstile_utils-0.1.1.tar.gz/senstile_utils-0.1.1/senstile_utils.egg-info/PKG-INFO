## Retry Utilities

The `retry` module provides functionality to automatically retry function calls, both synchronous and asynchronous, in the event of exceptions. This is particularly useful when interacting with systems that might temporarily fail and then succeed upon retry.

### Key Features

- `retry_call`: A function to automatically retry a synchronous function call upon exception.
- `retry_call_async`: The asynchronous counterpart to `retry_call`, for retrying asynchronous functions.

### Usage Examples

**`retry_call`:**

```python
from senstile_utils.retry import retry_call
import random

def sometimes_fail():
    if random.random() > 0.5:
        raise ValueError("Failed!")
    return "Success!"

# Use retry_call to attempt the function multiple times before giving up
result = retry_call(sometimes_fail, max_trials=5, delay_ms=500)
print(result)
```

**`retry_call_async`:**

```python
import asyncio
from senstile_utils.retry import retry_call_async
import random

async def sometimes_fail_async():
    if random.random() > 0.5:
        raise ValueError("Failed!")
    return "Async Success!"

# Use retry_call_async to attempt the async function multiple times
result = asyncio.run(retry_call_async(sometimes_fail_async, max_trials=5, delay_ms=500))
print(result)
```

## Event Emitter

The `EventEmitter` class provides a mechanism to implement the publish-subscribe pattern in Python. This design allows components of a system to communicate with each other without requiring them to be tightly coupled. Subscribers can react to events without direct knowledge of the publisher.

### Key Features

- **subscribe**: Subscribe to a specific topic and register a callback to be invoked when an event is emitted for that topic.
- **emit**: Emit an event to a specific topic, causing all registered callbacks for that topic to be invoked.
- **unsubscribe**: Unsubscribe a callback from a specific topic, preventing it from being invoked for future events on that topic.

### Usage Examples

```python
from senstile_utils.event import EventEmitter

# Instantiate an EventEmitter
emitter = EventEmitter()

# Define callback functions
def on_data_received(topic, data):
    print(f"Data received on topic {topic}: {data}")

def another_callback(topic, data):
    print(f"Another callback for topic {topic}: {data}")

# Subscribe callbacks to a topic
subscription1 = emitter.subscribe("topic1", on_data_received)
subscription2 = emitter.subscribe("topic1", another_callback)

# Emit an event to a topic
emitter.emit("topic1", {"message":"Data received",data:[1,0.9,0,1,2],user:"user@example.com"})

# Unsubscribe a callback from a topic
subscription1.unsubscribe()
```

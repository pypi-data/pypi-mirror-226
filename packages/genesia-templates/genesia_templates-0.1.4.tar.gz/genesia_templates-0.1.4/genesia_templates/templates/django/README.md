# Update an existing project

When developing a Django project, depending on what you modify, you might need to rerun certain commands. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Changes to Models**: If you make changes to the models in `models.py` (like adding/removing fields, changing relationships), you'll need to create and apply new migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Changes to Static Files or Templates**: If you're using Django's static files handling or templates and make changes to them, you usually don't need to rerun any specific command during development. The development server should pick up these changes automatically.

3. **Changes to Python Code**: If you make changes to views, URLs, settings, or other Python code, the development server usually automatically reloads the code. However, if you make changes to the settings file or encounter issues with code reloading, you might need to manually restart the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. **Adding a New Admin Interface**: If you add a new model to the admin interface in `admin.py`, you don't need to rerun anything specific; changes should be reflected automatically on the admin site.

5. **Changes to Tests**: If you modify or add tests, you'll need to rerun the test command to execute them:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

6. **Installing a New App or Library**: If you add a new app to `INSTALLED_APPS` or install a new Python library, you'll likely want to restart the development server to ensure that the new code is picked up.

7. **Changes to ASGI or WSGI Configuration**: If you modify `asgi.py` or `wsgi.py`, these changes typically require a server restart, especially in a production environment.


# Create a new project

Creating a new Django project is relatively straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Make sure you have Python installed**: You'll need Python, as Django is a Python web framework. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Django**: You can install Django using pip, a package manager for Python. Open a command prompt or terminal window and run:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

3. **Create a new project**: Once Django is installed, you can create a new project by running the following command:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```
   Replace "myproject" with the name you want for your project.

4. **Navigate to the project directory**: 
   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```

5. **Create a new application**: In Django, projects are made up of one or more applications. You can create a new application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```
   Replace "myapp" with the name you want for your application.

6. **Run the development server**: You can start the development server to see your project in the browser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Visit your project**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see a welcome page indicating that your project is running.

From here, you can begin building your Django project by defining models, views, templates, and more. You might find the [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/) to be a helpful resource as you proceed with development.

### Project Root Directory

The `manage.py` file would typically be auto-generated by Django when you create the project, and the `db.sqlite3` file would be created when you run the database migrations.

### Important Next Steps:

1. **Run Migrations**: To create the database tables for your models, run:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create Superuser**: To access the admin site, create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

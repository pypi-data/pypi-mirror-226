Prototype implementation of tools for the Simulation Pipeline of the `CTA Observatory <www.cta-observatory.org>`_:

* libraries for simulation model management and model database interface;
* applications for simulation model parameter derivation and validation;
* standardized interfaces and data products independent of the underlying simulation software (e.g., `CORSIKA <https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/>`_, `sim_telarray <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/~bernlohr/sim_telarray/>`_);
* I/O and reporting tools for the MC simulation model parameter and production database.

simtools is one part of the CTAO Simulation Pipeline, which consist of the following components:

- `CORSIKA <https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/>`_ air shower simulation code and the `sim_telarray <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/~bernlohr/sim_telarray/>`_ telescope simulation code.
- simtools for tools and application for model parameter and configuration management, database interfaces, validation, and production preparations.
- databases, especially the model parameter database.

This code is under rapid development. Please contact the developers if you want to use it.

"""Campbells - A condensed web scraping library.

https://www.github.com/lmmx/campbells

Campbells is adapted from Beautiful Soup under the MIT license.

Beautiful Soup uses a pluggable XML or HTML parser to parse a
(possibly invalid) document into a tree representation. Beautiful Soup
provides methods and Pythonic idioms that make it easy to navigate,
search, and modify the parse tree.

Like Beautiful Soup, Campbells works with Python 3.6 and up. It works
better if lxml and/or html5lib is installed.

For more than you ever wanted to know about Beautiful Soup, see their
documentation: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

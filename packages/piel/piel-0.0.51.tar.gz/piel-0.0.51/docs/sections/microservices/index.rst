Tools
==================

``piel`` aims to provide an integrated workflow to co-design photonics and electronics. It does not aim to replace the individual functionality of each design tool, but rather provide a glue to easily connect them all together and extract the system performance.


This package provides interconnection functions to easily co-design
microelectronics through the functionality of the
`IIC-OSIC-TOOLS <https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools>`__ and
photonics via `GDSFactory <https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory>`__.

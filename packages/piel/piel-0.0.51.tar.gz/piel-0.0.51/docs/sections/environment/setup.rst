Environment Requirements
=========================

Many of the great tools for microelectronic design are functional only
through Linux environments. This leads to an inherent barrier-to-entry
for designers that have not used Linux before. However, it is important
to note that not *all* tools require a Linux flow, and it is possible to
do co-design at different stages in different environments. This could
be useful to distributed teams, or at different stages of a design flow between prototyping a design and full optimisation iterations.

To guarantee full functionality of ``piel``, the recommended environment installation is following the standard IIC-OSIC-TOOLS installation configuration. However, this table of tools compatibility is provided should you use a specific set of toolsets in a given environment. No functionality guarantees are provided in that case.

This is a preliminary table, I mostly develop on Linux, you need to verify your system configuration or use the recommended Docker environment. TODO I am unsure about the OS X integrations.

In the future, we will have custom installations for different types of users so they can install minimal dependencies for their use case.

Multi-Platform Dependency Installation Commands
-----------------------------------------------

Maybe in the future I will write a mamba recepie.

.. code-block::
    mamba install ngspice -y # For NGPICE in any environment


Docker Configuration

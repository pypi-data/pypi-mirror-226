# ðŸ“· PyPPTXShot - A Python Screenshotting PPTX Generator
This small Python app serves as an automatic screenshotter (and 
optional auto-clicker) of a selected area in your screen with the help 
of PyAutoGUI and python-pptx. This is also uses Tkinter as its GUI.

PyPPTXShot was initially a past-time project to capture 
slideshow presentations that are undownloadable (probably because of a 
certain professor won't let it be downloadable for some reason during 
online class) and is displayed in a website instead (e.g., ISpring 
Presentation on Moodle).

The default save path of the generated PPTX file would be in the
desktop. While the default (and initial) filename is "pypptxshot_output-0". 
Best used with a console to view what is going on.

Contributions are welcomed!

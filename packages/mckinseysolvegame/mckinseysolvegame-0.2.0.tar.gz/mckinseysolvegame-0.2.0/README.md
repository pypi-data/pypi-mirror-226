This is a Flask API that allows you to solve the Ecosystem Building game from the McKinsey Solve Game, in which you need to find a sustainable chain of 8 species among many (39 in total). 

The API provides a single endpoint at /find-sustainable-food-chain that accepts a list of species and returns a solution that maximizes the number of species that can create a sustainable food chain.

## Installation

To install mckinseysolvegame, simply use pip:

```sh
pip install mckinseysolvegame
```

## Usage

### Define the product

```python
from mckinseysolvegame import Species

my_species = [
    Species(name="Producer1", calories_provided=4000, calories_needed=0, food_sources=[]),
    Species(name="Producer2", calories_provided=4050, calories_needed=0, food_sources=[]),
    Species(name="Producer3", calories_provided=5000, calories_needed=0, food_sources=[]),
    Species(name="Animal1", calories_provided=1000, calories_needed=1050, food_sources=["Producer1"]),
    Species(name="Animal2", calories_provided=800, calories_needed=900, food_sources=["Animal1", "Producer3"])
]
```

### Find the species that form a sustainable food chain

```python
from mckinseysolvegame import Solver

result = Solver.find_sustainable_food_chain(my_species)
result.to_json()
```

The API will return a JSON object with the following format:
```json
{
    "number_of_species": 5,
    "species": ["Producer3", "Producer2", "Producer1", "Animal1", "Animal2"]
}
```
This object contains the maximum number of species that can sustain, as well as the list of species names.

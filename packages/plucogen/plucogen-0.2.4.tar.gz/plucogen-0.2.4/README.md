# PluCoGen Core

## Introduction

PluCoGen, or Pluggable universal Code Generator, is conceived to be a modular program which reads data from datafiles (YAML, JSON,...) or databases and generates generic code with the help of templates (e.g. Jinja2). 

While YAML, JSON and Jinja2 are part of the core (for now), PluCoGen offers the possibility to add new formats by plugin modules.

## Current State

The project is currently in a very early stage and experiences rapid development. Until version 1.0.0 is reached, breaking of the API might occure at any time.

## Versioning

PluCoGen uses semantic versioning according to the SemVer specification.

## Contributing to Development

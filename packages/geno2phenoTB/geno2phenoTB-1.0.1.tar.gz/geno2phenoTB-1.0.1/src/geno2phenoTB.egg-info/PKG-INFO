============
geno2phenoTB
============

    geno2phenoTB is a machine learning based tool to predict resistance of *Mycobacterium
    tuberculosis* against antibiotics using whole-genome sequencing data.

Approximately 182.000 (range 113.000-250.000) patients die each year from tuberculosis (TB)
caused by a multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) strain of the *Mycobacterium
tuberculosis* complex (MTBC). The design of a MDR/RR-TB regimen requires detailed knowledge about
resistance against second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Performing phenotypic drug susceptibility
tests (DST) for multiple anti-tuberculosis drugs is time-consuming, laborious, and for some drugs
impossible.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are on the verge to replace phenotypic methods by
predicting drug susceptibility and resistance based on mutation catalogs. NGS can be performed on
direct patient specimen and results are available within days. Advances in machine learning (ML)
techniques allow unbiased predictions from genotype to phenotype within minutes. We combined state-
of-the-art expertise in ML and genome-based resistance diagnostics to develop an engine that
predicts drug resistance profiles from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.

We used genomic data, augmented with genotypic data (generated using a state-of-the-art
resistance mutation catalog (see [Grobbel21_] and [Finci22_]) of the Research Center Borstel
(FZB)), from a database we curated of more than 18000 WGS samples with phenotypic DST labels to
train ML models capable of predicting drug resistance from WGS data.

To find the best performing drug-specific models, different supervised learning methods such as
rule-based classifiers (RBC) utilizing Boolean compressed sensing, gradient-boosted trees (GBT),
logistic regression (LR), and random forests (RF) were compared.

In greater detail, we employed a 10-fold repeated nested stratified 5-fold cross-validation (CV)
protocol to train the models and to assess their performance. This included tuning of the model
hyper-parameters on the inner CV folds. In case of GBT, LR, and RF models, they were tuned for
maximum average precision (AP_) on the inner CV folds, while the classifiers decision threshold
was tuned for optimal F1 score on the training partition of the outer CV fold. In case of RBC
models, they were tuned for maximum Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), while no decision
threshold tuning was applied, since RBC deliver simple OR-rules.

To make the models more understandable and increase confidence in the resulting predictions,
either inherently interpretable models like RBC were used or model-intrinsic feature importance
values are output.

Results for 5 first-generation drugs (ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin,
streptomycin) and 7 second-generation drugs (amikacin, capreomycin, cycloserine, fluoroquinolones,
kanamycin, para-aminosalicylic acid, thioamides) show that the trained prediction models exhibit
comparable or better resistance prediction performance than a current resistance mutation catalog
of the FZB.

Finally, the best ML model for each of the 12 drugs was selected and implemented in a TB
resistance prediction engine. This constitutes the core of the geno2phenoTB package complemented
by state-of-the-art continuous integration and automatic deployment.
The geno2phenoTB package is mainly written in Python, hosted on GitHub, and can be easily and
directly installed via the common package manager conda.

Further, geno2phenoTB integrates a complete NGS data processing pipeline, namely MTBSeq, starting
from raw reads given via FASTQ files. Since the processing step is computationally intensive,
a tool that can be installed locally (e.g., on a workstation or supercomputer), like geno2phenoTB,
offers the advantage, compared to web-based tools, of being able to scale the execution as needed
and process even thousands of samples in parallel and, thus, quickly.

Installation
============

To install geno2phenoTB 1.0.1 and above from the bioconda channel, a clean conda environment is
required:

.. code-block:: console

    # Required clean environment
    conda create -n g2p-tb
    conda activate g2p-tb

    # Installation
    conda install -c bioconda geno2phenoTB

**Caution**: geno2phenoTB 1.0.0 is broken on bioconda - so **don't use it**.

While we recommend to install geno2phenoTB from bioconda, it can be installed using pip as well.
If you prefer to install using pip, you need to make sure that all requirements are fulfilled.
The simplest and recommended way in doing so is to create a conda environment containing all
dependencies (using the conda environment file located in `tests/g2p-test.yaml`_) before
installing geno2phenoTB via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    # Required environment with all dependencies
    conda env create -f tests/g2p-test.yaml
    conda rename -n g2p-test g2p-tb
    conda activate g2p-tb

    # Installation
    pip install geno2phenoTB

For installation directly from the source, please refer to the `installation documentation`_.

.. _tests/g2p-test.yaml: https://github.com/msmdev/geno2phenoTB/blob/main/tests/g2p-test.yaml

Basic Usage
===========
Two interfaces of geno2phenoTB are exposed. A command line interface (CLI) and a python interface.

Both interfaces require the path to a directory containing FASTQ files belonging to a single
bacterial sample as input. Under the hood we use MTBseq_ for the analysis of WGS data in the form
of FASTQ files from single end (one FASTQ file) or paired end (two FASTQ files) sequencing runs
(tested for Illumina and Ion Torrent files).

The FASTQ files must follow this naming scheme:

.. code-block:: text

    [SampleID]_[LibID]_[*]_[Direction].f(ast)q.gz
                        ^- Optional values.
    Direction must be one of R1, R2.
    Example: ERR551304_X_R1.fastq.gz

Here, [SampleID] represents the identifier for a specific bacterial sample and [LibID] is an
identifier (e.g., for the next generation sequencing library used). [Direction] is an essential
field and indicates if reads are in forward (R1) or reverse (R2) orientation in paired end data.
Files for single end data have to use the [Direction] R1. Other than these, file names can be
freely given, including further [*] fields.

geno2phenoTB can be used to analyze WGS data (using MTBseq), preprocess this data further, and
perform predictions of resistance against up to 12 antituberculous drugs.
In doing so, irrespective of whether the CLI or the python interface is used, several output files
are generated.

If only preprocessing is requested, the following files are output:

#. A file named '<sample_id>_resistant_genotype_variants.tsv' with resistance-related variants per
   drug.
#. A file named '<sample_id>_extracted_features.tsv' with per-drug genotypes.

If preprocessing and prediction is requested, geno2phenoTB outputs the files listed above plus the
following:

#. A file named '<sample_id>_feature_importance_evaluation.tsv' containing a table with feature
   importance values and resistance catalog info per drug.
#. A resistance report file '<drug>_resistance_report.txt' for each drug.

Drug-specific machine learning models and a resistance mutation catalog for the following 12 drugs
are implemented: AMK (amikacin), CAP (capreomycin), DCS (cycloserine), EMB (ethambutol), ETH
(thioamides), FQ (fluoroquinolones), INH (isoniazid), KAN (kanamycin), PAS (para-aminosalicylic
acid), PZA (pyrazinamide), RIF (rifampicin), STR (streptomycin).

Command Line Interface
----------------------
The CLI offers two modes. The run mode is used to preprocess the data and predict drug resistance:

.. code-block:: console

    usage: geno2phenotb run [-h] [--skip-mtbseq] [-p] -i DIR -o DIR --sample-id
                            SampleID
                            [-d {AMK,CAP,DCS,EMB,ETH,FQ,INH,KAN,PAS,PZA,RIF,STR}]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --skip-mtbseq         Skip the MTBseq step. Precomputed output must be
                            present in fastq-dir.
      -p, --preprocess      Run only the preprocessing steps.
      -i DIR, --fastq-dir DIR
                            Path to the directory were the FASTQ files are
                            located.
      -o DIR, --output DIR  Path to the directory were the final output files
                            shall be stored.
      --sample-id SampleID  SampleID (i.e. ERR/SRR run accession).
      -d DRUG, --drug DRUG  The drug for which resistance should be predicted. If
                            you want predictions for several drugs, use the
                            argument several times,i.e., -d AMK -d DCS -d STR. If
                            the flag is not set, predictions for all drugs will be
                            performed.

More advanced applications of the CLI are available and can be found in the `CLI documentation`_.

Example
*******

To predict the resistance of the sample (`ERR551304`) against all drugs use:

.. code-block:: console

    geno2phenotb run -i dir_to_ERR551304/ -o output_dir/ --sample-id ERR551304

Python Interface
----------------
Import geno2phenotb

.. code-block:: text

    import geno2phenotb

and use, e.g., the `geno2phenotb.predict.predict()`_ function of the
`geno2phenotb.predict`_ submodule to preprocess the data and predict drug resistance:

.. code-block:: console

    Parameters:

    fastq_dir : str
        Path to directory containing the fastq files.
    output_dir : str
        Path to output directory.
    sample_id : str
        Sample ID.
    skip_mtbseq : bool, default=False
        Do not run MTBSeq  but use preprocessed data.
    drugs : Union[str, list], default=None
        If None, drug resistance predictions for all drugs known to geno2phenoTB are determined.
        If a list of drugs is supplied, predictions will be only determined for these. The drug
        must be one of 'AMK', 'CAP', 'DCS', 'EMB', 'ETH', 'FQ', 'INH', 'KAN', 'PAS', 'PZA', 'RIF',
        'STR'.

    Returns:

    result : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame with the probabilities (for resistance) and predictions (1.0 for resistance,
        0.0 for susceptibility) for the requested drugs.
    feature_evaluation : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame listing the features (called variants, lineage classification, genotypes) plus
        an assessment of the relevance of each feature for the Machine-Learning-based and catalog
        based resistance prediction per drug. For each drug, two columns are given: '<drug>
        feature importance' and '<drug> catalog resistance variant'. The first contains the
        feature importance value derived from the Machine Learning model, the second informs if
        the variant is a known catalog resistance variant for the considered drug.
    rules : Dict[str, Optional[list[str]]]
        Dict of lists with features constituting a rule. If the used Machine Learning Model is a
        Rule-Based Classifier, rules[drug] is a list of features constituting a rule (the rule can
        be constructed by connecting the given features with boolean 'or' operators
        (disjunctions)). Otherwise, rules[drug]=None.

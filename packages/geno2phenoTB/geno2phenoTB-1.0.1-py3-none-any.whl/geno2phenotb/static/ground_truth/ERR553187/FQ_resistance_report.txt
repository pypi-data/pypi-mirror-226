Resistance report for sample ERR553187

Considered drug: FQ

Resistance prediction based on FZB resistance catalog: 0.0 (susceptible)

Resistance prediction based on Machine Learning: 0.0 (susceptible)

The Machine-Learning (ML) prediction is simply redundant to the catalog-based prediction, since the underlying ML model is a Rule-Based Classifier that learned only a simple rule: If the catalog-based prediction (aka genotype feature) is 'resistant', i.e., 'FQ_geno'=1.0, predict resistance. Otherwise, predict susceptibility.

Rule learned by the Rule-Based Classifier:
FQ_geno

# DelayedArrays, in Python

Pretty much as it says on the tin.
We just translated the [Bioconductor package of the same name](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DelayedArray) into Python.
We didn't even bother changing the class names, that's how ~lazy~ faithful we were to the original implementation.

## Install

Package is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/delayedarray/)

```shell
pip install delayedarray
```

## Usage

```python
COMING SOON
```

Check out the [documentation](https://biocpy.github.io/DelayedArray/) for more info.

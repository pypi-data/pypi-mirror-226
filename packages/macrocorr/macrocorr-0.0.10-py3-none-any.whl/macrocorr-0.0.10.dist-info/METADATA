Macrocorr (’macroeconomic correlation’) is a Python package for analyzing the correlation between macroeconomic indicators and time-series data. 

*Pearson's correlation* is used to analyze the correlation. This package uses [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)’s built function to get the Pearson coefficient. For details, please check out **[scipy.stats.pearsonr](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html).** 

This package is designed to provide the easy process of analyzing and comparing the correlations with multiple macroeconomic indicators at a single time. The result is intended to provide an overview of macroeconomic relationships. It should not be used for profitable purposes.

The data of the macroeconomic indicators are extracted from [WorldBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/) and [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup?s=DATA) historical database. This package doesn’t guarantee the accuracy of the correlated data.

## Installation

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from [pip](https://pypi.org/project/macrocorr/).

```bash
pip install macrocorr
```

## Usage
- For all macroeconomic indicators and all major categories, check out [CATALOG](https://github.com/SeoliKim/macrocorr/blob/main/Usage/CATALOG.md).
- For more detailed uses of the functions, check out [FUNCTIONS](https://github.com/SeoliKim/macrocorr/blob/main/Usage/FUNCTIONS.md).
- For a step-by-step example use-case, check out [example_basic.ipynb](https://github.com/SeoliKim/macrocorr/blob/main/Usage/example/example_basic.ipynb).

#### Quick Start

1. Import “correlator” from Macrocorr

```python
import macrocorr as mcrr
```

2. Create a correlator with the data you want to analyze

```python
my_correlator= correlator(date=my_data['Date'].values, data_x=my_data['Price'].values)
# data_x should be an one-dimensional array of numerical value
# make sure the values from date and data_x are matched
```

3. Analyze and compare the correlation with the macroeconomic indicators from a category

```python
my_correlator.analyze_Correlation(category='population', country='USA', top_num=3)
# print the top 3 most correlated indicators from the category (='population') 
# with their respective Pearson's coefficient and p-value
# plot the graph with both the input data and data of the most correlated indicator
```

4. Analyze the correlation with one specific indicator

```python
my_correlator.get_Correlation(y_name="Population, total", graph=True)
# print the Pearson's coefficient and p-value of the indicator (='Population, total') 
# plot the graph with both the input data and data of the indicator
```

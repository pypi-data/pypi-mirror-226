# Textbook Assembler
A tool for assembling a collection of PDF resources into a single "textbook"

While it's nice to teach from a textbook, the modern teacher has a huge array of resources to pull from, including unpublished notes, lecture slides, and even code repositories. Providing students with these resources as a huge library of PDFs is intimidating, disorienting, and confusing. This is especially true when you don't need the entire resource, only a few pages or slides.

This package aims to solve this problem by giving teachers an easy way to merge a large volume of files into a single "textbook", which can then be distributed to students. References and links are added to ensure proper credit assignment for everything used in the class.

# Portfolio data generator class
class PortGen:
    """Portfolio choice data generator class.

    This class generates synthetic choices of a portfolio choice model. It 
    takes the utility of each individual alternative and generates synthetic 
    choices and the 'true' log-likelihood function. `PortGen` allows for 
    unconstrained and constrained choice situations (i.e., with resource 
    constraints).

    Parameters
    ----------
    V : np.ndarray
        Array of deterministic utilities of each individual alternative.
    C : np.ndarray, optional
        Array of costs of each individual alternative, by default None
    delta_0 : float, optional
        Parameter of the marginal utility of non-spent resources. Must be 
        different from None if `C` is defined, by default None
    B : float, optional
        Available resources. Must be different from None if `C` is defined, 
        by default None
    base_combinations : np.ndarray, optional
        Array with initial set of combinations. Can be used to discard unfeasible 
        combinations upfront. If no list is provided, PortChoice will construct a 
        set of all possible combinations from a full-factorial design.
    mutually_exclusive : list, optional
        List of mutually-exclusive alternatives. Each element of the list is
        a numpy array of two elements that detail the two mutually-exclusive
        alternatives, by detault None

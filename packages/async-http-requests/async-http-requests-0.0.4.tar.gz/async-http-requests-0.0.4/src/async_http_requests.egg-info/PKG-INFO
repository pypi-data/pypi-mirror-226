# Async Requests

Python library to handle asynchronous http requests, built on top of the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library 


- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Installation

[PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/async-http-requests/)

```bash
pip install async-http-requests
```

## Usage

The library provide support for asynchronous http request, using the consumer-producer pattern.

Instantiate the class `AsyncHTTP` specifying a list of `RequestObject`, (you can specify `N_PRODUCERS` and `N_CONSUMERS`: default values are `50` for both)

The `RequestObject` supports all keyword arguments of the requests methods (`headers`,`params`,`data`, ...). It allows you to specify different keyword arguments across different requests 

```python
from AysncRequests import AsyncHTPP, RequestObject, RequestType,

# Public API endpoint, it retrieves all public APIs listed under params specification
# Refer to this if you want to know more https://api.publicapis.org/
api = 'https://api.publicapis.org/entries'

# default N_PRODUCERS and N_CONSUMERS to 50 

endpoints = [
    RequestObject(url = api, params = {"title":"cat"}),
    RequestObject(url = api, params = {"title":"dog"})
]

requests = AsyncHTTP(
    url = endpoints
) 


# specify number of producers and consumers

requests = AsyncHTTP(
    url = endpoints,
    N_PRODUCERS = 10,
    N_CONSUMERS = 10
)
```

To get the responses you can either call the generic `async_request` method explicitly specifying the http request type by passing to the `request_type` argument a `RequestType` Enum (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`),
or you can use the `async_get`, `async_post`, `async_delete`,`async_put`, `async_patch`, `async_head` method without having to spepcify the request type.

```python
requests.async_request(
    request_type=RequestType.GET,
)

requests.async_get()

```

All methods support additional fixed keyword arguments such as `headers`, `auth` etc. as per the usual requests module, in case you need certain arguments to stay fixed across requests 

For the additional paramaters refer to the requests module documentation [Requests docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

```python
headers = {'user-agent':'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/110.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'} # Keyword arguments FIXED for all requests

# Specify the RequestType

requests.async_request(
    request_type=RequestType.GET,
    haeders = headers 
)

# Using async_get

requests.async_get(headers = headers)
```

All methods support the use callback functions, to be used by the consumers on the `request.Response` object generated by the producers, as they become available in the `asyncio.Queue`

```python
def example_callaback(response: request.Response):
    return response.status_code 


requests.async_request(
    request_type=RequestType.GET,
    callback = example_callback,
    headers = headers
)

requests.async_get(
            headers = headers 
            callback = example_callback
)

```

The results will be stored in a list object, where you'll find either the `requests.Response` objects, or the output of the `callback` function.
Requests that return an error code will be saved in `requests.error_response`

```python 
requests.response
requests.error_response
```

Check the `test.py` script for an example.

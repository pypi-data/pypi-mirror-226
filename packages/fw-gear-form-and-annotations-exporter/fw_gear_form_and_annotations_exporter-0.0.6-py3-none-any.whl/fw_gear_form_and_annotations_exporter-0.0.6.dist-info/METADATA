# Form and Annotation Exporter

## Overview

### Summary

Export Form Responses and/or Annotations to CSV file(s).

### License

*License:* MIT

### Classification

*Category:* Analysis

*Gear Level:*

- [X] Project
- [X] Subject
- [X] Session
- [X] Acquisition
- [ ] Analysis


## Usage

The Form and Annotation Exporter gear is executed by ensuring the following
configuration parameters are provided and are in a valid combination. This gear has no
file inputs.

If the gear is run within a project for a protocol where the *protocol_name* is
not defined, the gear will fail.

For the *annotations-scope* and *form-responses-scope* configuration parameters, the
following combinations are valid:

- `task` and `both` settings require a valid *protocol_name* for a protocol defined
  within the project.
- `non-task` and `none` settings do not require a valid *protocol_name*. This allows for
  the export of annotations and form responses that are not associated with a task.
- if both *-scope* settings are set to `none`, the gear will fail as there will be no
  output.

Running this gear under a specific subject, session, or acquisition will constrain the
output to only those tasks, form-responses, and annotations that are associated with
the container and its children.

This gear will output select annotation properties for the following annotation types:

- Ellipse
- Circle
- Rectangle
- Freehand/Contour (closed)
- Length
- Angle

The gear will output the following annotation properties:

- Area
- Length
- Angle
- Units (of measurement)
- min/max X/Y coordinates of a bounding box of the annotation

### Inputs

This gear has no file input. The exported form responses and annotations will depend
on the level at which the gear is launched (e.g. project, subject, session, acquisition)
and the confiugration options selected.

### Config

* *debug*
  * **Type**: *boolean*
  * **Description**: *Log debug messages*
  * **Default**: *False*
* *protocol_name*
  * **Type**: *string*
  * **Description**: *The name of the protocol to export data from.*
  * **Optional**: *True*
* *annotations-scope*
  * **Type**: *string*
  * **Description**: *The scope of the exported annotations.*
  * **Default**: *task*
* *form-responses-scope*
  * **Type**: *string*
  * **Description**: *The scope of the form responses.*
  * **Default**: *task*

### Outputs

The Form and Annotations Exporter gear has the following outputs:

- form-responses-\<datestamp\>.csv
- annotations-\<datestamp\>.csv

For form responses and annotations that are coordinated with a task, the above outputs
will correspond to the same Task ID and the `Location` column of the annotations CSV
will correspond to the matching `Question` with a `Answer` of `yes`. The question will
take the form of `<question #>: <Location>` (e.g. `2: LV`).

Both output CSV files are in a "narrow" format where each row represents a single form
response Question/Answer or annotation Property/Value pair. Each of these CSV files can
be converted to a "wide" format using the `pandas` Python library with the [`pivot`
command](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html). A
[data dictionary](./data_dictionary.csv) is provided for the CSV files.

#### Example Conversion to Wide Format

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
root_dir = Path('~')
# Read in the CSV file
form_responses_path = root_dir / 'form-responses-2023-05-13_08-47-26.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(form_responses_path)
index_cols = [col for col in list(df.columns) if col not in ['Question', 'Answer']]
df_wide = df.pivot(index=index_cols, columns='Question', values='Answer').reset_index()
df_wide.to_csv(root / (form_responses_path.stem + '_wide.csv'))

# Read in the CSV file
annotations_path = root_dir / 'annotations-2023-05-13_08-47-26.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(annotations_path)
index_cols = [col for col in list(df.columns) if col not in ['Property', 'Value']]
df_wide = df.pivot(index=index_cols, columns='Property', values='Value').reset_index()
df_wide.to_csv(annotations_path.stem + '_wide.csv')
```

#### Example of Merging Form Responses and Annotations

```python
import pandas as pd

annotations_wide_df = pd.read_csv('annotations-2023-05-13_08-47-26_wide.csv')
form_responses_wide_df = pd.read_csv('form-responses-2023-05-13_08-47-26_wide.csv')

# Ensure that the common columns have the same datatypes
form_responses_wide_df=form_responses_wide_df.astype(object)
annotations_wide_df=annotations_wide_df.astype(object)

# Get the common columns between the two dataframes
common_columns = set(annotations_wide_df.columns)
common_columns = list(common_columns.intersection(set(form_responses_wide_df.columns)))
common_columns = [
  col for col in common_columns if col not in ['Created', 'Modified','Revision']
]

# Acquisition and File Name may not be common columns
common_columns = [
    col
    for col in common_columns
    if col not in ["Acquisition Label", "acquisition.id", "File Name", "file.id"]
]

# Merge the two dataframes on the common columns
merged_df = pd.merge(
  annotations_wide_df, 
  form_responses_wide_df, 
  on=list(common_columns), 
  how="outer"
)

# More than one annotation per task.id will produce multiple rows for the same task.id
merged_df.to_csv('merged_annotations_and_form_responses.csv')
```

The columns of each CSV output are described below.

#### **form-responses-\<datestamp\>.csv**

On form-response-scope being `task`, `non-task`, or `both` and a non-empty response,
the gear will output a CSV file containing the form responses for the specified
protocol.

The file name will be prefixed with `form-responses-` and suffixed with the datestamp
of the export (e.g. `form-responses-2023-05-13_08-47-26.csv`). The CSV will contain the
following columns:

* **Task ID**: The ID of the task the form response is associated with (e.g. R-2-1)

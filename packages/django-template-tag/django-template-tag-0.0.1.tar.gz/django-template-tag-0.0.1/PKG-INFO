## Project Scope

This project serves as an exploration of the sllist topic and is not intended for global use.
## Package Functionality

The package I have developed is specifically designed for handling integer data. It does not support other data types, and therefore, no tests have been conducted using non-numeric data. If you encounter errors while using non-numeric values, please note that such behavior is expected.
## Functionality and Testing

The package offers a variety of functions that may cater to your needs, along with corresponding tests to help identify any errors. If you intend to modify any of the functions, it is advisable to test their functionality to ensure their effectiveness.
## Documentation and Code Comments

Detailed documentation for each function can be found in the index.py file. This documentation provides a clear understanding of each function's purpose, parameter types, input requirements, return values, and data types of the output. Additionally, the code includes brief comments alongside each function, describing its functionality and usage.

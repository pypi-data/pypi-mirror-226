r = requests.post("localhost:2728/signup", json=data)

print(r.json())
```
Returns ```{"svid": ..., "password": ...}``` or ```{"error": ...}```


<br>

2. Signin

```python
import requests

data = {"email":"someone@example.com", "password": "someRandomPass123"}

```python
import requests

# Authentication parameters svid and password are MUST
data = {"svid": ..., "password": ..., "type":"plant_tree","tree_name": "YOUR TREE NAME", "tree_password": "YOUR TREE PASSWORD"}
r = requests.post("localhost:2728/tree", json=data)

print(r.json())
```

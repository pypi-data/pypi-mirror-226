=======
Tools for processing and analyzing neurophysiological signals recorded in-vivo.


ivneuro provides tools for analyzing neural signals recorded in-vivo during behavior. It 
focus on time series analyses of continuous variables such as Local Field Potentials and 
is optimized to process either single signals in a single condition as well as multiple 
signals in multiple conditions simultaneously. It also provides a subpackage for extracting 
data from Nex files.
